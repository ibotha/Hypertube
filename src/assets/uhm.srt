Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

30
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:52,886
Today, as promised,
I'm gonna share

31
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:55,795
my zucchini chocolate
chip cookie recipe.

32
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,171
But first,

33
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:00,418
many of you have asked me for
an update on the Emily situation.

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,928
And for those of you who
are new to my vlog,

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,565
you should know my

36
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,725
best friend Emily
is missing right now.

37
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,086
She asked me
a simple favor

38
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,103
to pick up her son,
Nicky from school

39
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:14,050
which was five days ago.

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,179
And she hasn't
come back yet, so.

41
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,865
I'm sorry, we're
all really worried

42
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,503
and I'm doing everything I can

43
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,321
to help the police
track her down.

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,524
I'm realizing I don't

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,231
know her as well as
I thought I did.

46
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:34,810
It's like my mom used to say,

47
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,655
God rest her soul, um,

48
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,523
"Secrets are like margarine;

49
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,809
"easy to spread,
bad for the heart."

50
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,225
But as different as we are,

51
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,931
I do consider
Emily my best friend.

52
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,111
She's this wonderful,
elegant person.

53
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,328
And our sons brought
us together, actually.

54
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:52,936
<i>Well, for, you know,
for our new friends,</i>

55
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:54,651
<i>I'll just start from the beginning.</i>

56
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:57,240
<i>I met Emily a few weeks ago</i>

57
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,924
<i>at school.</i>

58
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,489
<i>It was International
Cuisine Day</i>

59
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:02,062
<i>in my son's first-grade class.</i>

60
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,128
<i>And once again, I drew Sweden</i>

61
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,367
<i>which meant my famous
meatless meatballs.</i>

62
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,929
You're all dead!

63
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,905
I killed everyone!

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,350
Not me.
I came back to life.

65
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:15,901
I want to thank everyone who
participated in today's feast.

66
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:17,231
Yay!

67
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,288
Class, haven't we
learned so much

68
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,010
about food from
around the world?

69
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,324
Yes!

70
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,277
Give your parents a big
round of applause!

71
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:26,962
Big smile!

72
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,694
Like, where does she get
all that energy from?

73
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:30,815
What are you lookin' at?

74
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,481
I think there's crystal
meth in those meatballs.

75
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,414
Ooh, uh, parents, there's a
sign up sheet on the board

76
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,644
for our fun fair next week.

77
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:41,302
Uh, please, Stephanie, don't
sign up for more than one job.

78
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:44,219
I'm not sure everyone else has
had a chance to volunteer.

79
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,652
Miles, sweetie, sweetie,
maybe just be careful

80
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,946
with your fingers with
Nicky's truck, okay?

81
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,720
Has Nicky's mom volunteered?

82
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:53,880
Emily?

83
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,086
Like she would know a sign up
sheet if it bit her on the ass.

84
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,819
God, it'd be my dream to
run PR for Dennis Nylon.

85
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,453
Can you imagine all the
free shit she must get?

86
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,380
I know.

87
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:03,161
Okay, I'm crossing
myself off decorations.

88
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:04,630
I can leave that open for Emily.

89
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,704
And then if she can't make it,

90
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,482
I can still bring my
balloons and helium tank.

91
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:10,041
Please tell me you don't actually
own a helium tank, Stephanie.

92
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,276
I think lots of people
own helium tanks, Stacy.

93
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,796
'Cause kids love balloons.

94
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,313
Do you not have one,

95
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,670
you bad parent?

96
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm kidding.

97
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:20,817
We're terrible parents.

98
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,349
I think it's a perfect
plan, Stephanie.

99
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:26,090
Good thinkin', Sss-tephanie.

100
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,761
Hey, smooch, aww...
great work today, smooch!

101
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,047
Smooch?

102
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,067
- Thanks a lot, Mom.
- Aw...

103
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,639
Can me and Miles have
a playdate today?

104
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:38,919
Um, I don't know, sweetie,

105
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:40,420
I think we need
to ask your mommy

106
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,025
and she's still in the city.

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,384
She's right there.

108
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:08,809
Come here, little dude!

109
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,381
Ooh, my baby.

110
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,579
Mm, mm, look at your shirt.

111
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,465
Did any food make it
in your mouth?

112
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,006
Ask her, Nicky, ask her!

113
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:17,429
Ask me what?

114
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,619
We want a playdate.

115
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:20,654
Oh, we can't. Mommy
already has a playdate

116
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,757
with a symphony of
antidepressants.

117
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:25,314
- Let's go.
- Playdate! Playdate! Playdate!

118
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:26,695
Nicky, please don't do this.

119
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,719
I gotta go, c'mon.
I got a ton of work to do.

120
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,368
You won't let me have any fun.

121
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,211
That's not true, I let you

122
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,292
tear my labia
as you exited my body.

123
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:35,356
So you're welcome.

124
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:39,654
You drink?

125
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,275
I need a martini.

126
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:44,397
Oh, uh, yeah, I like martinis.

127
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:46,319
I haven't had one in
a-a long time.

128
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,399
They're good though.

129
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,217
Had one that was like,
mostly chocolate.

130
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,419
And I was like, oh, chocolate.
Oh...

131
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:52,589
Mom life...

132
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,420
Oh, okay. No playdate.
C'mon, kid, let's go.

133
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:56,787
Then I'm staying here.

134
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:59,649
Christ, he's fucking stubborn.

135
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:01,796
It doesn't have to have
chocolate in it. Like...

136
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,882
Okay, I don't think
I'm gonna win this.

137
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,728
So, um...

138
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:08,769
I mean, do you wanna come over
for a beverage of any kind?

139
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,825
I think I could use some backup.

140
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,303
That's me? I'm backup?

141
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,098
Does your kid drink? Maybe?

142
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,089
It's never too early
to start teachin' 'em.

143
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:18,101
I think you're joking.
But, great.

144
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,438
- Sweetie?
- You, let's go.

145
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,583
Let's get your
umbrella out, okay?

146
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:22,861
'Cause we're gonna
go out in the rai-i-in.

147
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:26,036
What on earth are those two
gonna talk about?

148
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,873
Emily's gonna eat poor
Stephanie alive.

149
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,338
At least she'll be
eating something.

150
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:33,664
What is your problem?

151
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,245
Go show him your room.

152
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:44,485
Go.

153
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,494
Oh, please don't run...
Be safe please.

154
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:51,286
Cute socks.

155
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,708
Oh, thanks.

156
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,312
Uh, they're from Target.

157
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:56,958
It's ten bucks a pack.
So great. Target.

158
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:59,341
They have other animals.
They have these squirrels.

159
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:00,929
- They're cute, chipmunks.
- Mmm.

160
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,757
Beavers.

161
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,006
That's... so...

162
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:06,516
lifelike!

163
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,659
Yeah.

164
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:08,810
D'you like it?

165
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,625
Ah... how could you not?

166
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,720
It's, um...

167
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:12,752
Right?

168
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,517
I used to dye my hair.
I get bored easily.

169
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:19,053
Yeah, um...
did you paint that?

170
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:22,030
No, no, no. It's made by an
almost famous painter

171
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,193
from the East Village.
Half my life is littered with

172
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,423
almost somebodies.

173
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,084
I did some work
modeling in school

174
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,545
to pay my way through.

175
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,821
But then the pervert
got obsessed with me.

176
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,473
Oh, well, that happens, yeah.

177
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:33,975
So I stole the painting from him

178
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:36,179
thinking it would be worth
something someday, but no.

179
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,054
No such luck.

180
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,137
This house is incredible.

181
00:07:42,193 --> 00:07:43,669
Thanks. It's a
fucking money pit.

182
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:44,821
Oopsy.

183
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:45,944
Hmm?

184
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,055
Oh, sorry, it's um,

185
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:50,399
what we say at my house
when someone swears.

186
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:51,606
It's a force of habit.

187
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,933
We have a...

188
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:55,982
an oopsy jar on the pantry.
It's like, you know,

189
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:58,421
put a quarter in
for every bad word.

190
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:00,272
You should smash the oopsy jar.

191
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:01,581
It might change your life.

192
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,512
Yeah... yech, sorry.

193
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,785
Don't say sorry.

194
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,721
You don't need to do that.
You don't need to apologize.

195
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,182
It's a fucked up female habit.

196
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,965
You don't need to be
sorry for anything ever.

197
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:13,037
That's-That's true. That's
great advice. Thank you.

198
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,446
- I love this music, by the way.
- Thanks.

199
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:20,212
Yeah. Makes me forget
I'm stuck in this shithole.

200
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:21,683
I'm gonna go get booze.

201
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:22,808

211
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,316
Come on,
give me a little more.

212
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:58,318
Ooh.

213
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,662
I like that.
I may join you later.

214
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,475
Oh, you must love cooking
in this kitchen.

215
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:07,159
No, not really,
but Sean does.

216
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,409
I think it's probably just
an excuse to avoid writing.

217
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:11,655
Your husband's a writer?

218
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,024
No, h-he wrote a
book ten years ago.

219
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:15,435
It made him
the toast of the town.

220
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,007
I actually had to stalk him
to make him fall in love with me.

221
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:19,253
Then nothing, he never,

222
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,167
he never wrote
anything ever again.

223
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,791
It's so bait and switch.

224
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:23,839
What was the book?

225
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,737
It's called <i>Darkness at Dawn.</i>

226
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,286
Oh, my gosh! I read that
in my book club.

227
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:29,353
- Really?
- This was...

228
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,243
Yeah, this was back when
I first became a single mom

229
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:32,388
and I joined this book club

230
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,642
and that was
the first book we read.

231
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,866
It's... I, it's so impressive.

232
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,408
So you're divorced, then?

233
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,691
Widowed.

234
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:43,646
Do you mind
if I asked how he died?

235
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,828
Car accident.

236
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,822
- Oh, how awful.
- Yeah.

237
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,878
My brother Chris was
in the passenger seat.

238
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,499
You're kidding.

239
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:02,732
In one fell swoop

240
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,953
and the two most important
men in my life were gone.

241
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,721
Normally, sad stories

242
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,365
don't get to me,
'cept for that one.

243
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,903
That one did.
That was brutal.

244
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,850
I don't talk about it a lot.

245
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:14,257
Especially with people
I just met. I'm really sorry.

246
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,323
Oh... hmm...

247
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:16,387
Baby, if you apologize again,

248
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:18,237
I'm gonna have to
slap the sorry out of you.

249
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,273
Yeah. That's so, I'm not sorry.

250
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:21,894
That's a hard habit
to break, though.

251
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:23,230
It is.

252
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:24,922
So, you dating anyone?

253
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:26,262
No.

254
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:27,811
Slim pickin's in Warfield.

255
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,996
Well, you are an hour and
a half outside the city.

256
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,855
I'm not gonna date
someone from the city.

257
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,861
I tried eHarmony for a while,

258
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:37,187
um, and then
that mother of three

259
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:38,446
wound up with her
head in a trash can.

260
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,173
You remember that?
And I... oof.

261
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,405
I said, no, thank you.
Don't need it.

262
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:44,136
What?

263
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,007
C'mon, baby, you're
too sexy to give up.

264
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,286
That's nice. I don't know, um...

265
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,953
If your head's gonna
end up in a trash can,

266
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,695
your head's gonna
end up in a trash can.

267
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,259
Didn't think I would
end up a single mom.

268
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:58,294
Struggling to make
ends meet, it's...

269
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,122
I mean, my husband
had life insurance.

270
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,717
Thank goodness,
but not a lot.

271
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,029
I put half of that away
for Miles' college and

272
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:06,152
so with that coming in,

273
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,464
the money still
runs out in 2020.

274
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,609
Thank God for his life insurance.

275
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:12,792
- Yeah.
- My husband doesn't have anything.

276
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,851
Makes me feel better,
but he does spend

277
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,210
like he's the man of the hour.

278
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,258
I fucking have to
pay for everything.

279
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,262
We can't even sell this house.

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,812
We bought it during
the bubble and...

281
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,311
I love your house.

282
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:25,346
I wouldn't dream of selling it.

283
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:27,432
If I were you, I'd just...

284
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,810
I'd just bask in the
kitchen all day long.

285
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:32,633
Maybe you should move in.

286
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,776
Here, cheers to
being house poor.

287
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,057
Yes, cheers!

288
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,793
- Mmm.
- What?

289
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,486
That's, uh...

290
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,152
It's just another one
of my bad decisions.

291
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,266
Yeah.

292
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:49,030
It's-It's great,
is that a charity symbol?

293
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,658
Yeah, Mother Teresa and I are
like, the same person, so.

294
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,978
It's a nice contrast
with your ring.

295
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,419
Thanks, well, this is
a family heirloom.

296
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,960
It belonged to Sean's great
grandmom and then his mom

297
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,789
and she insisted
that I have it, so.

298
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:03,053
Whose Subaru is
blocking the garage?

299
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,111
Speak of the devil.

300
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,880
Oh, that's mine.
I'm sorry, I...

301
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,866
- You're what?
- Nngh...

302
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:09,885
Your wife is trying to get
me to stop apologizing.

303
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,150
Maybe you can get her to start.

304
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:13,309
Ooh.

305
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,739
- Hi.
- Mmm.

306
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:16,545
Hi.

307
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,457
Oh, martini time.

308
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,198
I'm sure it's 5:00 somewhere.

309
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:22,486
Oh, my God, did you just come up
with that cliché by yourself?

310
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:23,936
He's such a brilliant writer.

311
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:26,210
I have to say you inspire me.

312
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:27,616
Not enough, apparently.

313
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,035
"Well, thank you very much

314
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,636
for going to the grocery
store," he said,

315
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,840
dripping with sarcasm.

316
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,689
Oh, I figured you'd want a break
from not writing... ever.

317
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:37,712
Uh-huh!

318
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:40,412
With that fatal blow,
she won the joust.

319
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:41,341
Mmm.

320
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,072
- Well played.
- Thank you.

321
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,438
This is Stephanie.

322
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,463
Our kid goes to
Warfield with her kid.

323
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,043
She read your book.

324
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,496
I-I did. I loved it!

325
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,138
It reminded me of
William Thackeray.

326
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,179
She really read it.

327
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:54,123
Wow.

328
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,402
Not many people train on
Thackeray as a reference.

329
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:58,792
Oh, I was an English
major at Barnard.

330
00:12:58,824 --> 00:12:59,902
It was pre-mommy brain.

331
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,673
I did my thesis on
the Canterbury Tales.

332
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,796
"And with that word
Arcite gan espy

333
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,889
"Whereas this lady
roamed to and fro"

334
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:10,084
"And with that sight,
her beauty hurt him so"

335
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,242
I'm sorry, do you guys
wanna get a room?

336
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,704
Am I breaking this up?

337
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:15,188
I like that.

338
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,930
Hey, do you want me
to make you a drink?

339
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:19,234
No, I'm good. You guys enjoy.

340
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,584
I'm gonna head
upstairs for a shower.

341
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:21,710
Okay.

342
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:23,825
Pleased to meet you, Sharon.

343
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,550
Yeah.

344
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:27,079
It's lovely to meet you!

345
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,171
He's terrible with names.

346
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:31,070
Oh, yeah, I mean,
'Stephanie' is

347
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,102
crazy, like, p-h, what?

348
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,624
You guys are
such a cute couple.

349
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,772
Yeah, we're on the
verge of bankruptcy.

350
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:42,437
And uh, we can't find a decent
nanny in all of Connecticut, so.

351
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:44,824
Drowning.

352
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,873
If you ever need me to
pick up Nicky after school,

353
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:48,088
take him to my house,

354
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:50,665
even if... you just
need the night off...

355
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:52,425
You'd do that for me?

356
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:54,454
Yeah, anything.

357
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:04,563
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

358
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:06,127
If it's your first
visit to the vlog,

359
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,605
a hearty welcome.

360
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,244
Today's theme is friendship.

361
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:12,528
So today I thought
we would make...

362
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,727
friendship bracelets!

363
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:18,746
<i>I have never
understood these silly</i>

364
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,824
<i>hurtful divisions
between working moms</i>

365
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,076
<i>and stay-at-home moms.</i>

366
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:25,011
<i>Honestly, I have found it difficult
to make friends with either.</i>

367
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,439
Emily!

368
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:27,959
Hi! What's up, lady?

369
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,626
<i>Hey, I was wondering if I could</i>

370
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:31,412
<i>take you up on your
offer to pick up Nicky.</i>

371
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,415
<i>I'm in a meeting
with no end in sight.</i>

372
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,685
Uh, yeah, I'm happy
to help, actually.

373
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,907
Um, I just got these jumbo
set of curler beads...

374
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,396
<i>Yeah, yeah, okay.
You're the best.</i>

375
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:42,503
Yeah, okay, um, just, does Nicky
have any dietary restrictions?

376
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,614
<i>Yeah, yeah, just uh,</i>

377
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,192
<i>just don't feed him
shit he doesn't like.</i>

378
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,712
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- Don't feed...?

379
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:47,942
Okay.

380
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,263
Oh, my God. She's so funny.

381
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,192
Whoo.

382
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,099
<i>No, no, no, Dennis.
This is what's gonna happen:</i>

383
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:59,066
I'm gonna do my job.
You're gonna take some pills.

384
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:01,241
And then I'm gonna
call you later, okay?

385
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:03,962
What? Oh, oh! I can't hear you.
I-I'm in an elevator.

386
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:05,475
I am hungry for flesh!

387
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,521
Just...

388
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,568
Darth Mommy, it's this game...
it's really silly.

389
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,413
Honestly, his dad was much better
at the roughhousing stuff.

390
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:20,240
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

391
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:21,629
Don't denigrate
your good parenting

392
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,385
to comfort me for my
shitty parenting.

393
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,404
Oh, gosh, no, Emily, that's,

394
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:27,835
that's not what I was doing at all.
I think you're a super mom.

395
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,256
Aw, no, you don't.

396
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:31,547
C'mon, you coulda had lobster
bisque for lunch the other day.

397
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:33,501
I'm lucky if I remember
my kid's lunchbox.

398
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,583
Honestly, it's fine.

399
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,110
The nicest thing I could do for
Nicky is blow my brains out.

400
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:42,346
I'm kidding.

401
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:44,236
Right, yeah, you, um...

402
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:47,204
You work in the city, so.

403
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,155
Did you just take my picture?

404
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,859
I'm yearbook mom.

405
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,607
Did I ask you
to take my picture?

406
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,953
- Erase it.
- Um, you look really chic.

407
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,768
It's just for faces and places...
just for the other parents.

408
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:06,793
Erase it

409
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,794
or I'll slap a fucking
injunction on your yearbook,

410
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,411
- d'you understand?
- Yeah. Okay.

411
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:12,149
Yeah, it's gone.

412
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,054
Woof. Bye-bye.

413
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:15,294
Don't do that again.

414
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:20,182
Oh, my gosh, so sorry...
or I didn't mean to offend you.

415
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:23,416
Um, I'm sure that stuff's
really sensitive and you're...

416
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:25,171
No, no. So it's all good.

417
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,411
I guess I'm probably
not the kind of person

418
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:27,642
you're normally friends with.

419
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,110
Oh, you do not want to be
friends with me. Trust me.

420
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:33,322
Dennis, sweetie,
let's try this again, um...

421
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:35,884
Okay, I want you to go home
and chill the fuck out

422
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:37,839
and don't ever call me again.
Bye.

423
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,539
That's how you
talk to your boss?

424
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,630
Yeah, you gotta
go right at 'em.

425
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,027
Especially the powerful ones

426
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:45,771
or they will fuck you in the face.

427
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,158
Yeah. I get that.

428
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:49,765
Wanna get outta here?

429
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,233
Mommy needs a drink.

430
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,088
Yeah. Totally.

431
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:55,298
Nicky!

432
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,969
Come here, guys!

433
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,514
I guess we're going.

434
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,041
Hey, Nicky! Bounce! Now!

435
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,466
Okay, I have a gift for you.
Please close your eyes.

436
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,552
Mnh-mnh.

437
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,012
Yeah. Hold out your
tattooed hand, please.

438
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,649
This is happening.
I'll wait all day.

439
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:11,521
- Are you propositioning me?
- Yes.

440
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:14,058
Good. I made that for you.

441
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:16,936
You made this for me?

442
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,059
Thought it would go with that
pinstripe suit you have.

443
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:22,519
Really, that-that's nice, no one
does stuff like this for me.

444
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:26,393
I used to um, watch those
<i>Bewitched</i> reruns on TV Land.

445
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:27,714
And I always thought
it was so classy when

446
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:28,805
Darren would
come home from work

447
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,645
and Samantha would
fix him a martini.

448
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,878
Every time we do this,
I feel so high tone.

449
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,457
My God, you're such a nerd.

450
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:39,304
Fuck this, I need a real martini.

451
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,060
- This one's not real?
- Nope.

452
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,359
Sean and I had the real
thing at Dukes in London.

453
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:45,207
The key: frozen gin.

454
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:46,836
And a frozen glass.

455
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:48,111
Okay.

456
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:49,674
Move, bad martini.

457
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,360
'Kay.

458
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,918
Little bit of vermouth.

459
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:55,135
Swirl it around.

460
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:56,467
Dump.

461
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,722
Don't you dare
touch that washcloth.

462
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,579
Then, add in your gin.

463
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,278
Mmm.

464
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,720
You need a twist.

465
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,505
Squeeze it, outside up.
Get a nice little mist.

466
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:11,753
Lick the edges.

467
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,667
And voila. And don't
add fucking ice.

468
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:15,818
- Ever.
- We don't like ice anymore?

469
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:17,422
Shit ruins everything.

470
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:18,952
Tough day at work?

471
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:21,135
I just need to hit the
reset button sometimes.

472
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:23,728
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

473
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:34,743
Make me one of those?

474
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,047
Do I look reset?

475
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:40,003
'Cause I feel reset.

476
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,310
You smell good.

477
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:45,452
What is that perfume?
You smell so good.

478
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:46,651
- I wish I smelled like you.
- Thank you.

479
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,447
Uh, i-it's one of Dennis'.

480
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:50,767
I can get you one.
I can get you a bathtubful

481
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:51,869
if you'd like.

482
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,972
I do, I-I would lo-
I would love, love

483
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,572
love it, girlfriend.
Thank you.

484
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,052
I'm really unhappy with myself

485
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:01,493
for taking that picture.

486
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,138
Oh, my God, are you still
talking about that?

487
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:04,290
It was so rude.

488
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,844
- It was like, ooh, paparazzi.
- Stop. Forget about it.

489
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,911
You are so nice.

490
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:08,494
I have no idea how you've
survived this long.

491
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,798
I'm not as nice
as you think, so.

492
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:11,918
Are you baiting me?

493
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:14,339
No! I'm just saying...

494
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,583
- Everybody has a dark side.
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:21,274
Some of us are better at
hiding it than others.

496
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:22,673
Wanna trade confessions?

497
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,768
- N-No. No.
- Come on.

498
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,498
What's the wildest thing
you've ever done?

499
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,344
Oh, I dunno, no, I shouldn't...

500
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:30,871
You go first.

501
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,578
Okay, um...

502
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:36,923
A few months ago, Sean and I
had his TA over for um,

503
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:39,241
dinner and drinks
and a threesome.

504
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:42,986
Well, was Sean jealous of him?

505
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,686
Did I say it was a him?

506
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:50,318
That's very cool, sis.
Very cool.

507
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:51,984
- You okay?
- Yeah!

508
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:53,378
I don't mean
to freak you out.

509
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:54,571
Hello?

510
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,346
What d'you mean freaked out?
Maybe you're freaked out.

511
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:59,011
'Cause I'm not freaked out.
I'm cool. I'm laissez-faire.

512
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:00,927
Okay, laissez-faire, I...

513
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,627
I mean, you're not exactly a
sexual maverick, and that's fine.

514
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,287
You know, prudes are people too.

515
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,722
I wanna know your secret, tell me.

516
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,116
My dad died when
I was a senior in high school.

517
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:15,317
<i>And...</i>

518
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:18,039
<i>this boy showed up
for the funeral.</i>

519
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,491
<i>His name was Chris.</i>

520
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:23,882
<i>And I guess he is</i>

521
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,653
<i>the spitting image of my
father 30 years younger.</i>

522
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:30,733
<i>So my mom</i>

523
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,546
<i>thought she saw a ghost...</i>

524
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:40,052
<i>And it turned out
he was my half-brother.</i>

525
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:43,748
That's-That's your whole secret?

526
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,526
That your-your
dad had an affair?

527
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:46,923
No!

528
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,854
Okay, can you just tell me
your secret? Come on.

529
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,749
Spill it, dark side.

530
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,559
So, Chris...

531
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,101
<i>It was too late for him to drive
home, so he stayed over.</i>

532
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,101
<i>We stayed up all night talking.</i>

533
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:00,386
<i>And...</i>

534
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:02,972
<i>my dad was...</i>

535
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,365
My dad was really the
person who understood me.

536
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:07,120
And he was gone, so.

537
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:09,712
I was...

538
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:12,156
alone, alone for the first time.

539
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:13,682
<i>But he...</i>

540
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,501
<i>sees me, you know?</i>

541
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:17,203
<i>Like he really sees me.</i>

542
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:21,570
And we just stared at each other
for the longest time.

543
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,822
Wait, you can't be too drunk at
my house not to finish the story.

544
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,640
- What happened?
- Yeah... uh...

545
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:28,477
Okay, so...

546
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:31,423
I don't know, maybe it's not
so racy where you're from, but,

547
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:33,393
Stop avoiding.
Tell me what happened.

548
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,451
<i>We stood there
for the longest time.</i>

549
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,097
<i>So, I went in to hug him and...</i>

550
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:39,217
<i>we kissed.</i>

551
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,531
<i>I know. It's so gross.</i>

552
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:43,779
- The end?
- Yeah.

553
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:44,934
- You just kissed?
- Yeah, we kissed.

554
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,042
You just kissed y-y-your brother?

555
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,889
<i>- Yeah, it's so...
- What?</i>

556
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:50,789
<i>Well, it was like, uch,
it's so lurid.</i>

557
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,947
<i>It's my half-brother,
it's not my brother, but it's...</i>

558
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,744
<i>- It's your half-brother though. Okay.
- It's like...</i>

559
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,212
<i>- It's, but...
- Yeah, there's more.</i>

560
00:21:56,254 --> 00:21:57,859
<i>- No. No, there's no more.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

561
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,287
No, no. Yeah, there is.

562
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:00,401
- Mmm.
- So.

563
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,457
You fucked him.

564
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:02,933
What?!

565
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,105
<i>Was he good?</i>

566
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:06,456
<i>That is so disgusting.</i>

567
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,416
<i>I don't know.</i>

568
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,925
<i>- Oh, you didn't fuck him?
- I don't...</i>

569
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,076
<i>Tell me you didn't fuck him.</i>

570
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,523
<i>- I don't know what's going on in here.
- Swear.</i>

571
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,565
<i>I swear.</i>

572
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,940
Swear on your dad's grave.

573
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:17,489
Uh...

574
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:33,758
Oh, my God.

575
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:39,519
- Don't.
- You're a brother fucker!

576
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,887
This is good.

577
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,818
Oh, my God.

578
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:46,869
I've got a brother fucker
taking care of my kid.

579
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:48,259
I shouldn't have said anything.

580
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,062
Brother fucker.

581
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:51,794
You know what? I don't know.

582
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,175
It's these stupid martinis.

583
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,605
Hey, brother fucker,
do you wanna stay for dinner?

584
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,862
I shouldn't have
even said anything.

585
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,822
Yeah. I do.
Wanna stay for dinner.

586
00:22:57,847 --> 00:22:58,920
That would be lovely.

587
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:00,430
I can't wait to see
what you cook.

588
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:01,988
Y'know what? I...

589
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,512
I'm gonna cook you

590
00:23:03,537 --> 00:23:04,561
the best meal of your life

591
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:07,603
and you're gonna feel really bad
about being so mean right now.

592
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:08,988
- Mmm! Fucker!
- Ow!

593
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:10,512
I like you!

594
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,443
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

595
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:14,597
Today we'll be talking about
perfect first-aid kits.

596
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:16,494
You never what you'll
need during a crisis.

597
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:21,668
Hi!

598
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,907
<i>Stephanie, thank God
you picked up.</i>

599
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:24,743
<i>Hey, I just have
a little emergency.</i>

600
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:26,959
Oh, really? Um, that's
a coincidence, I was just...

601
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:28,077
<i>I-I need your help.</i>

602
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,347
Uh, are you okay?

603
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,054
<i>I'm fine, but I-I do need</i>

604
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,619
<i>just a-a simple favor.</i>

605
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,689
<i>Can you grab Nicky from school?
Sean's in London.</i>

606
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:35,981
<i>His mother broke her fuckin' hip</i>

607
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:37,608
<i>and I got a big fire
to put out at work.</i>

608
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,753
Oh, yeah! Oh, my God.
Poor Sean.

609
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,271
Poor you, um...

610
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:43,544
Anything I can do
to help, yeah.

611
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,149
<i>You're the best.
Hey, I gotta run.</i>

612
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,950
<i>But I'll get you back
for this okay?</i>

613
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:48,719
Of course.
Nicky's in good hands.

614
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:51,499
<i>Hey, Stephanie,
you're a good person.</i>

615
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,803
<i>True fat, I mean that.</i>

616
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:55,504
Don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

617
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,755
Freeze!
Do you know what I see?

618
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:04,709
I see two boys
getting a playdate!

619
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,813
- Yay!
- Yay!

620
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:09,532
Stephanie, it's so great
you took the nanny job.

621
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,684
Nanny job?

622
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:12,397
Yeah, for Emily. I know
she was looking for one.

623
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:16,221
Well, that...

624
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:18,157
Um, we're just friends.

625
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:19,530
I'm helping her as a friend.

626
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:22,124
Oh, God. I'm so-I'm so sorry.
I didn't,

627
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:24,242
I didn't realize you
guys were so close.

628
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,343
Well, we are!

629
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,844
We drink martinis together.

630
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:29,275
Strong ones from London.

631
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,142
Okay, boys, if you don't
wrestle in the car,

632
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,799
I'm gonna make you for brats!
Let's go!

633
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:34,402
- Go!
- Yay!

634
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:38,782
She doesn't know
she's working for free.

641
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,695
Hey, uh, Em, it's Stephanie.

642
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:08,278
Um, I know you're probably
knee-deep in that crisis.

643
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,511
Um, but Nicky's asking when
you're coming to get him

644
00:25:10,536 --> 00:25:12,456
and I don't know
what to say, so.

645
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,903
Just let me know.

646
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:15,549
And I hope you're
hanging in there.

647
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,755
Give 'em heck.

648
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:19,744
<i>Stephanie Smothers,
I'm a close friend of hers.</i>

649
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,078
<i>I'm watching her son.</i>

650
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:23,343
Can you just tell
me where she is?

651
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:24,447
When she might me back?

652
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:25,527
<i>Yeah, she's in</i>

653
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:28,711
Miami for a few days. Uh, did
you wanna leave a message?

654
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,998
I'm s-I'm sorry, did you say
a few days?

655
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:32,428
Yeah, could you hold on
for a second, please?

656
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:34,315
<i>She didn't say
it was gonna be a few...</i>

657
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:35,934
Oh, for the love of Job.

658
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh!

659
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,442
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Sean! Hi.

660
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,250
Um, it's Stephanie.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

661
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:43,416
I got your number from

662
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,134
<i>- the school directory.</i>
- Has something happened to Nicky?

663
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:46,557
<i>No, uh, Nicky's</i>

664
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:47,906
fine. He's...

665
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:50,114
Yeah, sorry, he's fine.
He's here with me.

666
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:53,916
Um, Emily though asked
me to watch him and...

667
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,326
that was two days ago

668
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:57,454
and I haven't heard from her.
Have you,

669
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:58,613
<i>have you guys been in touch?</i>

670
00:25:58,686 --> 00:25:59,958
Christ, two days?

671
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:01,101
<i>What'd she tell you?</i>

672
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,657
Um, she said she had
to put out a big fire.

673
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:05,929
And I called her office and
they said she was in Miami?

674
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:07,440
<i>Yeah, that sounds about right.</i>

675
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:10,102
I mean, I've played through
some of these emergencies

676
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:12,762
<i>before and once she knows
Nicky's being taken care of,</i>

677
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,047
<i>she disappears for</i>

678
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,161
quite some time.

679
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,305
Oh, fun! Um...

680
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,591
I'm flying back tomorrow.

681
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:20,514
I'll pick up Nicky as soon
as I'm on the ground.

682
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:21,827
<i>Alrighty?</i>

683
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,041
Alrighty.

684
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,226
Ah.

685
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,107
Miss Canterbury Tales.

686
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,072
Um, her assistant Valerie said that

687
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:34,573
she couldn't get in
touch with her either,

688
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:38,252
which is weird 'cause it's a
work thing, uh, an emergency.

689
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,689
Some of the moms think
we should go to the police.

690
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,075
Jesus, it's really come to this.

691
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,054
Do you want tea?

692
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:46,889
Well, let's do it.

693
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,193
Not the tea, the police.

694
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,554
- Sean?
- Yeah.

695
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,665
The police are here.

696
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:54,478
Okay.

697
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,917
And when was the last time
either of you heard from her?

698
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,380
Three days ago.

699
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,452
I was in London.
My mother broke her hip.

700
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:11,473
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

701
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,931
She said it was a work crisis?

702
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:15,643
Yeah, she has a
high-profile job and

703
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:17,548
a full staff that she oversees.

704
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:20,591
Most times, when a woman
vanishes, she has a reason.

705
00:27:20,824 --> 00:27:22,149
What are you implying exactly?

706
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,881
You two didn't have a fight?

707
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:25,621
Something to make you
run off to London?

708
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:27,338
Are you saying that
I broke my mother's hip?

709
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,411
You leave town,
the wife takes off.

710
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:31,821
Maybe there's um...

711
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:34,639
close friend she might be
spending some time with?

712
00:27:34,664 --> 00:27:36,411
Excuse me, that's very rude.

713
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:38,605
He's a dedicated
husband and father.

714
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,495
I've seen him with his wife.
Let me tell you,

715
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,440
they've got more chemistry
than a science fair.

716
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,854
Just exploring all avenues, ma'am.

717
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,648
Well, that avenue's a dead
end, so you can drop it.

718
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,421
And where's Emily's family?

719
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:50,836
Um, she doesn't have any.

720
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:52,496
She was and only child and

721
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:54,917
her mother and father died
when she was a teenager.

722
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:57,725
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

723
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:59,385
We'll file a missing
persons report

724
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:01,639
and contact you in the
next couple of days.

725
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,183
If she doesn't turn up,

726
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:05,279
we'll contact the local
authorities in Miami.

727
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:08,211
Not planning any more trips,
are you, Mr. Townsend?

728
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:10,381
Nah, I'm gonna be right here.

729
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:13,844
I'm gonna be at my house
with my son.

730
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:15,729
We can show ourselves out.

731
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,948
<i>God knows we've had our
troubles in the past.</i>

732
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:23,662
But... I don't think she'll just
up and leave her child.

733
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:26,995
No! God, she adores Nicky.
She wouldn't do that.

734
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:28,930
She's an enigma, my wife.

735
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,315
It's what drew me to her.

736
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:32,015
It could also make her impossible.

737
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:33,904
She could be so fiercely private.

738
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,415
She sure doesn't like
having her picture taken,

739
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,532
I'll tell you that.

740
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:38,457
I remember this one time
she shut down my Facebook

741
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,640
because I posted up
her family picture.

742
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,679
Ugh, social media's so tricky.

743
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,964
You can get close to her,

744
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,441
but you can never
quite reach her.

745
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:48,007
She's like a beautiful ghost.

746
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:50,050
Never entirely there.

747
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,726
That's so poetic, you know.

748
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:53,427
That's why you're
such a good writer.

749
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,477
I'm not a writer
anymore, Stephanie.

750
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:59,357
I gave all that up just to chase
this woman for the rest of my life.

751
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:03,359
I should call for a taxi
and go home.

752
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:04,392
Yeah.

753
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:06,970
Oh, gosh, it's 1:25.

754
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:08,653
They stop driving at 1:00 here.

755
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:12,390
That couch pulls out

756
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,327
um, if you want to stay over.

757
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:17,234
I know Nicky would love it if
you were here in the morning.

758
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,311
That would be lovely.

759
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:38,259
Who wants more B vitamins?

760
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,863
- I do!
- Yeah?

761
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,556
- That nice?
- Yeah.

762
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:42,905
Yeah? Delicious?

763
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:44,655
- Hi.
- Hey.

764
00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:47,372
Um, what on earth
are you making?

765
00:29:47,414 --> 00:29:49,350
These are hangover smoothies.

766
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,861
They'll get it right out of you.

767
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,281
And kids love them.

768
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:53,480
An old tip.

769
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,402
They have a full
portion of vegetables

770
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:56,918
and they don't even know it.

771
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,289
It's so hard to get kids
to eat their vegetables.

772
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:00,337
Right?

773
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:02,347
Mmm.

774
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,124
Try some?

775
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:06,026
Great!

776
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:12,931
Good?

777
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:17,434
I think we should
get ready for school.

778
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:18,865
Ugh!

779
00:30:18,976 --> 00:30:20,873
Oh, school, school.

780
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,107
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

781
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:24,847
Today, I'm making a
new recipe I read

782
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:26,451
for a hangover smoothie.

783
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:27,851
Uh, it's really nice.

784
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:30,774
I especially want to thank
everybody who's written in

785
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:32,258
to ask about Emily.

786
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:34,691
It's been four days now.

787
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,735
So.

788
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:39,902
The good news is that
Sean is home from London.

789
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:42,278
And he's working very
closely with the police.

790
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:43,676
Um...

791
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:44,701
Actually...

792
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:45,932
Moms,

793
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:48,858
I know a lot of you are
hung up on the idea

794
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:51,128
that the husband is always
the primary suspect.

795
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,830
I know. I've seen <i>Law & Order.</i>

796
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,592
<i>But um...</i>

797
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:57,032
<i>I mean, first,
I'm here to tell you</i>

798
00:30:57,175 --> 00:30:59,541
<i>Sean was in London
when Emily disappeared.</i>

799
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,250
<i>And some of you
have suggested that</i>

800
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,847
<i>he did that to set up an alibi.</i>

801
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:08,149
<i>But he's an amazing husband
and an amazing father.</i>

802
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,819
<i>So, the police haven't
been much help.</i>

803
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,833
<i>But everyone knows, if you
want something done right,</i>

804
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:14,024
<i>you have to do it yourself.</i>

805
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,759
<i>I will leave no stone unturned.</i>

806
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,307
<i>Think that's what I'm
gonna move on.</i>

807
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:20,006
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

808
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:23,423
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

809
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:26,394
Thanks for holding. How
may I direct your call?

810
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,128
Hi, uh, my name's Stephanie...

811
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,724
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

812
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:31,527
My friend works here,
she's been miss...

813
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:33,392
Thanks for holding. How
may I direct your call?

814
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,555
She... uh, I tried to
call her assistant...

815
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,055
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

816
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:38,335
Valerie, she wasn't super help...

817
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,147
Thanks for holding. How
may I direct your call?

818
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:41,570
I can't tell if
you're talking to me.

819
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:43,023
You're looking right
at me, but I can't...

820
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:45,288
- Dennis Nylon... please hold.
- Okay.

821
00:31:45,313 --> 00:31:46,797
Thanks for holding. How
may I direct your call?

822
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:47,964
Her name's Emily Nelson.

823
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,996
She's the head of
the PR department.

824
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:51,244
Emily's not in today.

825
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:53,406
I know she-I know she's
not in. She's...

826
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:54,844
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

827
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,092
Okay, just...

828
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,309
Sorry. No. I'm not sorry.

829
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:00,828
Um, I...

830
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:02,923
need to speak to
Dennis Nylon, please.

831
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:05,077
A woman's missing, so.

832
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:06,831
Mr. Nylon's not here right now.

833
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:08,359
Great, I'll wait.

834
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,645
Knock yourself out.

835
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,426
Okay.

836
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:29,419
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

837
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,549
Um, Mr. Nylon.

838
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,574
We don't accept
unsolicited résumés.

839
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,297
Cool. That's not why I'm here.
Um, we have a problem.

840
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,762
We most certainly do.

841
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:39,674
A friend of mine works in
your publicity department.

842
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:41,151
Is that vintage Aramis scarf?

843
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:42,893
My Aunt Frieda gave it to me.

844
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,204
Did she want you to hang
yourself with it? Look at that knot.

845
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:46,505
Jesus fucking Christ.

846
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,867
I'm here about Emily Nelson.

847
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,463
What about Emily?
What happened?

848
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:51,902
She asked me to pick up
her son four days ago

849
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:54,555
because she went to Miami.
She's still not back.

850
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:56,745
No texts, no calls and no one in
your office seems to give a crap.

851
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:57,830
Excuse my language.

852
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,476
- Kiko...
- Hmm?

853
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:02,261
Why did Emily go to Miami?

854
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:03,733
I didn't know she did.

855
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:07,609
We in this office
have learned that

856
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:09,268
when Emily elects
not to tell us something,

857
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,649
it's best not to ask.

858
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:12,143
Doesn't she work for you?

859
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:14,499
Emily's job is to
stop the apocalypse

860
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,237
without worrying
any of the designers.

861
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,263
And she always finds a way to
look fabulous when she does it.

862
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,592
That's great!

863
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:22,769
What do you suggest that I do?

864
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,223
Never wear a vintage Aramis
scarf with a Gap t-shirt.

865
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,069
If you were truly Emily's
friend, you would know that.

866
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,406
Excuse me, I have
a very busy day.

867
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:33,928
Valerie. My office. Now.

868
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,260
Motherfuck.

869
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:31,166
Well, if it isn't Aunt
Frieda's least favorite niece.

870
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,525
What were you doing up there?

871
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,360
Corporate spying or just a
common garden shoplifter?

872
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,527
Yeah, you gotta go right at 'em.

873
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:39,997
Especially the powerful ones

874
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,814
or they will fuck you in the face.

875
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:44,242
Listen, you bargain
basement Tom Ford.

876
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,130
If you don't have this Ken
doll unhand me this second,

877
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:48,289
I will tell the thousands
of moms that watch my vlog

878
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:50,686
that Dennis Nylon is a bully
who victimizes women.

879
00:34:50,776 --> 00:34:52,419
And that they should stop
buying your tacky blouses

880
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,784
made by Indonesian children

881
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:55,729
because if you lose moms,
you lose business.

882
00:34:59,154 --> 00:35:01,631
Okay, number one: they're
not Indonesian children,

883
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:03,266
they are Vietnamese teenagers.

884
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:06,332
Number two: Tom Ford
wishes he were me.

885
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,741
And number three: if I'm tacky...

886
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,341
okay...

887
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:12,968
you're...

888
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:14,404
This has been fun.

889
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,297
Better pray I don't have a bruise.

890
00:35:28,444 --> 00:35:30,396
I know she doesn't like
having her picture taken.

891
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:38,377
Look at our little Stephanie.

892
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,281
Comforting the worried husband.

893
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,535
Oh, please.

894
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:43,574
It's an arts and crafts project.

895
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:46,407
I've never seen her pass up
the chance to use a stapler.

896
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,697
Emily's gonna hate those
flyers when she gets back.

897
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,903
She's not coming back.

898
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,212
Don't you watch <i>Dateline?</i>

899
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:58,093
If the case isn't solved
in the first 72 hours,

900
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,460
they're always dead.

901
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,195
Oh, yeah.

902
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:05,221
Oh, perfect timing.

903
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,302
Dinner's ready.

904
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,161
The boys are upstairs,
I'm just gonna have them

905
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,448
wash their hands
and come down...

906
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,860
Um...

907
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,249
Are you okay?

908
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:15,641
I just never experienced
anything like this.

909
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:18,500
Walking into a fully
set dinner table.

910
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:20,804
Yeah, uh, this is...

911
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:22,831
- weird, I mean...
- No, no, no, no.

912
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:24,017
Not at all.

913
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:25,105
I think anything

914
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,311
stable these days is like
a gift from heaven, right?

915
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:29,323
I should tidy up first, though.

916
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:35,964
- Hello, Mr. Townsend.
- Ah, yes.

917
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:37,504
Detective Summerville,
we spoke on the phone.

918
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:38,562
That's right.

919
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:40,692
Stephanie, can you help the
boys with their homework?

920
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:41,779
Of course.

921
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,893
Come in.

922
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,380
Just a pre-dinner

923
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:47,967
snack.

924
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,416
That's a cute nanny.

925
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:53,225
No, no, that's
one of my wife's friends.

926
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,770
She's been helping me out.

927
00:36:56,306 --> 00:36:58,639
Well, shit, can she help out
around my house, too?

928
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:04,904
She wasn't on any
flights to Miami.

929
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:07,406
But she did rent a white
Kia from Budget.

930
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:09,648
She paid in cash for
a two-day rental.

931
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:11,189
Now, when people pay in cash,

932
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:12,771
it usually means one thing.

933
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:15,003
Are you saying she's
having an affair?

934
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,726
I can't say that
with any confidence.

935
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,178
Can't anyone else
track her Kia?

936
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:21,123
I'll have reports coming in
from across the country.

937
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:22,822
So, let's just not
spark an outbreak.

938
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:25,336
We gave the description of
your wife to every precinct

939
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:27,279
in the tri-state area, okay?

940
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:29,466
Does she have any
distinguishing features?

941
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,256
Have any birthmarks, tattoos?

942
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,027
She's got a tattoo
on her left wrist.

943
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,141
Great.

944
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:37,013
Flames and a charity symbol
in the middle.

945
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:39,136
Really?

946
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:41,185
- More judgment from you.
- No, no, no.

947
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:42,590
She did things like that.

948
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:44,578
Impulsive, crazy things.

949
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,144
I'm gonna call this in.

950
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,311
Tell your wife's friend
I said goodbye.

951
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:52,388
You're a saint.

952
00:37:52,428 --> 00:37:53,563
You don't have to do that.

953
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,047
I'm not a saint, I just
like to keep my hands busy.

954
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,783
Um, I should go.

955
00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:00,025
It's Flags of the
World Day on Monday.

956
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:01,620
Started on South America.

957
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:05,273
Sorry.

958
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:08,457
No, I didn't mean sorry,
I mean, thank you.

959
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:10,435
Thank you for being
such a good friend.

960
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:11,761
Of course.

961
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:14,169
I'm a problem solver.
I just wish I could do more.

962
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,758
You're doing plenty.

963
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:25,888
So that's where we are today.

964
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:27,215
And we are keeping our heads up

965
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,875
and not jumping to
any conclusions.

966
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:30,184
We are soldiering on.

967
00:38:30,371 --> 00:38:31,935
Cookies and origami.

968
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,740
But for you moms
who want to help,

969
00:38:34,923 --> 00:38:37,129
we know that Emily
was driving a white Kia.

970
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,966
that she rented from a Budget

971
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:41,085
uh, at LaGuardia
airport on the 24th.

972
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:45,467
And I did a little digging, so,
um, the license plate is...

973
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:54,057
<i>Dear Stephanie, I'm writing
from Standish, Michigan</i>

974
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,676
<i>with a possible Emily sighting.</i>

975
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,980
<i>I was driving down
I-75 two days ago</i>

976
00:38:58,076 --> 00:39:00,108
<i>when I saw a woman
gassing up a white Kia.</i>

977
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:02,041
<i>She was really pretty
and I remember thinking</i>

978
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:03,876
<i>she didn't look like
she was from around here.</i>

979
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:05,012
<i>I hope this help...</i>

980
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:07,762
So, um,

981
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:10,366
several of us sent the info to
the local authorities in Michigan.

982
00:39:10,623 --> 00:39:12,893
Did she ever mention Michigan?
Did she have a friend there?

983
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,840
As far as I knew, she didn't
have any real friends.

984
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:17,573
- Not before you.
- Oh.

985
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:19,329
I, uh, how is that possible?

986
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:24,884
Hello? Please tell
me you found her.

987
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,902
A lake?

988
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,966
Well, I... I don't know.

989
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,335
Okay, I'm heading there now.

990
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:34,764
They found a rental car
in Michigan.

991
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:36,185
Look, I'm gonna have to go

992
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,654
'cause otherwise,
I'm gonna go crazy.

993
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:39,781
- Can you do me a favor?
- Yes, it's done. Go.

994
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,577
<i>Hi, moms. Stephanie here.</i>

995
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:45,785
I can see we have a flood
of new viewers today.

996
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,782
And if you're new to the vlog,

997
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,594
I'm sorry, this probably isn't
the best entry to start with.

998
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:54,596
<i>For those of you who have been
following my vlog this week,</i>

999
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:57,503
<i>you know that my best
friend, Emily went missing.</i>

1000
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:01,088
<i>And so many of you wrote in
with your helpful tips and ideas.</i>

1001
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:03,025
<i>And I want to</i>

1002
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,787
<i>give a special thanks
to LeAnn Lippins</i>

1003
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:08,657
<i>whose helpful tip made a
major break in the case.</i>

1004
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:12,738
<i>I... have some somber news.</i>

1005
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:16,518
<i>Emily was found.</i>

1006
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:21,563
<i>Not alive, I'm afraid.</i>

1007
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:26,258
<i>My friend Emily... Nelson</i>

1008
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:28,852
<i>is dead.</i>

1009
00:40:43,622 --> 00:40:44,741
<i>Our Father,</i>

1010
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:47,342
<i>We look to you again
facing this moment...</i>

1011
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:49,668
<i>that our sorrow, grief,</i>

1012
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,077
<i>and loneliness</i>

1013
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,016
will rise up to Yourself

1014
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:56,231
that we may know the comfort
of everlasting life.

1015
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,455
Especially support
and comfort those

1016
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,387
who have been closest
to our departed sister.

1017
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,468
Sustain them in the
blessed assurance

1018
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:06,159
that death is conquered
and new life has begun.

1019
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:08,138
To be absent from the body

1020
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:09,861
is to be present with the Lord.

1021
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:11,611
May we be assured in the hope

1022
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,708
that we shall walk
together again

1023
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:15,407
in Your blessed presence.

1024
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,784
Help us to number our days
that we may

1025
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:20,498
apply our hearts
unto wisdom.

1026
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,243
In the name of the Father,

1027
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:23,918
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

1028
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,707
Amen.

1029
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:35,417
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1030
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:38,110
Are those, um...?

1031
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,564
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they are.

1032
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:41,200
Uh, Th-they're from your uh,

1033
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:42,773
'Last-minute Brownie' entry.

1034
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:45,100
I can't believe
you watch my vlog.

1035
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:46,906
Uh, well, I mean,
to be honest,

1036
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:48,660
when we were first started
watching it, we were just

1037
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:50,446
making fun of you, but um,

1038
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:53,658
uh, but-but then you had some
really helpful hints in there.

1039
00:41:53,785 --> 00:41:55,563
Especially when Lulu
got that rash...

1040
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,342
- Apple cider vinegar, it was great.
- Oh!

1041
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:58,647
Well, great.

1042
00:41:58,885 --> 00:41:59,933
Yeah.

1043
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,725
You're a real saint
to help her family out like this.

1044
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,204
I'm not a saint, I'm...

1045
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,530
Emily was my friend and she'd
do the same for me, so.

1046
00:42:08,587 --> 00:42:11,770
If-If you or Sean need me to
watch Miles or Nicky anytime,

1047
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:12,976
it's nothing.

1048
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:15,014
That's so sweet, Sona,
thank you.

1049
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,044
I mean, it's the least she could do.
She didn't even bake anything.

1050
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:19,810
- I'm gonna... Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1051
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:23,229
Nicky, you don't need to worry.

1052
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,571
Your mom's in heaven now.

1053
00:42:24,596 --> 00:42:26,360
No, she's not! Shut up!

1054
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,845
You need to run from me.
You're never coming back.

1055
00:42:29,996 --> 00:42:31,330
You're hurting me!

1056
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:33,015
- I hate you!
- Stop it!

1057
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:35,729
Nicky, get off him!

1058
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:38,213
Nicky, what are you doing?!

1059
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:39,952
Get off him. What the
hell are you doing?!

1060
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:41,168
Calm down. Stop that.

1061
00:42:41,212 --> 00:42:43,585
She needs to stop,
she made my mom die!

1062
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:44,786
That's crazy
and you know that.

1063
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:46,176
She's trying to be
my new mom!

1064
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:47,414
Sweetie, I'm not trying
to be your mom.

1065
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:48,501
I want my mom!

1066
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:49,994
I know you do, baby,
I know you do. But I'm...

1067
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:52,178
Mom was right.
You are a loser.

1068
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,372
Is that what she told you,
drunk at 2:00 in the afternoon?

1069
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:57,467
I am trying my best!

1070
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,559
Sean!

1071
00:42:58,699 --> 00:42:59,977
He's just a little boy, Jesus.

1072
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,256
I'm sorry.

1073
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:02,585
What do I do?

1074
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,736
- Okay.
- What do I do?

1075
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:06,340
We're gonna take a deep,
centering breath now, all right?

1076
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:08,604
Now focus on
one thing at a time.

1077
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:10,660
I'm gonna stay, talk to Nicky.

1078
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,232
So, I need you to
take Miles inside

1079
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,576
put some ice on his nose.

1080
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:15,463
You got a good little
shiner comin'.

1081
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,461
It's okay.

1082
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:19,509
It's okay.

1083
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:23,920
I don't wanna talk to you.

1084
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,098
Well...

1085
00:43:26,894 --> 00:43:29,539
You're not my favorite dinner
date right now either, mister.

1086
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:31,079
But you should know that

1087
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:32,975
everything you're feeling
right now is normal.

1088
00:43:33,463 --> 00:43:35,645
You can act out all you
want, that's fine.

1089
00:43:35,703 --> 00:43:37,227
This doesn't change what I know.

1090
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,592
What do you know?

1091
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,397
That you're a good kid.

1092
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:45,063
So, let's just sit here
and not talk.

1093
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:48,706
Let's just sit here and

1094
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:50,913
feel lousy and
watch the grass grow.

1095
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,347
Hey.

1096
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:28,892
Hey, come on.

1097
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:30,757
Don't be hard on
yourself, all right?

1098
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:33,108
This is the kind of stuff
nobody gets right.

1099
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,396
You do.

1100
00:44:34,825 --> 00:44:36,960
- You always do.
- No, no, come on.

1101
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,005
I don't know if...

1102
00:45:02,716 --> 00:45:03,734
Yeah.

1103
00:45:03,759 --> 00:45:05,553
You're right, we... shouldn't.

Hey, Miss Smothers!

1153
00:47:58,265 --> 00:47:59,409
Can I talk to you?

1154
00:47:59,448 --> 00:48:00,750
Yeah, I'm...

1155
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:03,298
come right down.

1156
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:07,326
Shit!

1157
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:10,537
- Hi! Hi.
- Hey. Hey.

1158
00:48:10,573 --> 00:48:13,311
- So...
- Uh, I just left something here,

1159
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:15,947
so I was just,
I uh, had a key

1160
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:17,654
'cause earlier,
Sean gave me a key.

1161
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:19,025
You're not under arrest,
Miss Smothers.

1162
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,574
- Oh!
- Just FYI.

1163
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,551
I know I'm not.

1164
00:48:22,689 --> 00:48:24,602
- Uh! No.
- No, no, I uh...

1165
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:26,211
- You're very funny.
- Yeah.

1166
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:27,243
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1167
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,123
Um...

1168
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,512
Sean's not here right now.

1169
00:48:30,561 --> 00:48:32,997
You know, I was actually
hoping to speak to you.

1170
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:33,896
Oh.

1171
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:35,151
Yeah, I went by your house,

1172
00:48:35,176 --> 00:48:36,090
and then went by the school,

1173
00:48:36,115 --> 00:48:38,605
and then one of the moms
thought you might be here.

1174
00:48:38,657 --> 00:48:39,792
- Did they? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1175
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:40,848
Well, that's...

1176
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,589
Was it Stacy?

1177
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,779
Can I come in?

1178
00:48:44,481 --> 00:48:46,347
Of course, I would love that.

1179
00:48:46,418 --> 00:48:47,910
Entrez vous.

1180
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,233
You said that uh,
Emily's your best friend.

1181
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:51,796
Uh, yes.

1182
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:53,074
Yes, we are.

1183
00:48:53,122 --> 00:48:54,121
Was she depressed?

1184
00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:55,273
No.

1185
00:48:55,578 --> 00:48:56,729
No, she had everything.

1186
00:48:56,776 --> 00:48:58,665
She had the house and the job.

1187
00:48:58,721 --> 00:48:59,799
And the husband.

1188
00:49:00,783 --> 00:49:01,948
I was getting there, yeah.

1189
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,933
Oh, and the neighbors say
they fought a lot.

1190
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:06,834
Well, they had issues, um...

1191
00:49:06,937 --> 00:49:08,556
They loved each other intensely.

1192
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:10,164
What issues did they have?

1193
00:49:10,593 --> 00:49:12,934
They're normal issues. They
were stressed about money.

1194
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:16,740
And I think Emily wanted to
slow down and smell the roses.

1195
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:18,602
She slowed down, all right.

1196
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:22,096
I got the autopsy report
right here.

1197
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,020
Let's see here...

1198
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:26,886
Severe liver damage
suggesting heavy alcohol use.

1199
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:30,534
Track marks along her arms
and between her toes.

1200
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:32,582
I mean, were you aware
of the heroin use?

1201
00:49:35,763 --> 00:49:38,525
No. That's uh... I'm...

1202
00:49:39,194 --> 00:49:41,869
I'm sorry, I... really have
trouble believing that.

1203
00:49:41,894 --> 00:49:42,858
- Me too.
- She...

1204
00:49:42,883 --> 00:49:44,739
She liked a very
strong martini, but...

1205
00:49:44,805 --> 00:49:49,671
I don't know how shh...she could
have kept that a secret from me.

1206
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:51,977
And especially from
her husband, Sean.

1207
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:53,891
Yeah, but you seem to know
Sean pretty well.

1208
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:56,458
I have, we've gotten
to know each other

1209
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:58,228
uh, over the... last few weeks

1210
00:49:58,253 --> 00:49:59,564
just as friends.

1211
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:00,746
Uh-huh.

1212
00:50:02,368 --> 00:50:04,773
I'm guessing you've never dealt
with law enforcement before.

1213
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:14,070
- Not really, no.
- Hmm.

1214
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:17,885
That's a really nice dress.

1215
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:19,695
Oh. Thank you.

1216
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,925
Doesn't seem to be
your style, though.

1217
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,886
Oh, I'm very versatile...
Detective. I think you'll find.

1218
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,161
I'm really just trying to...

1219
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:30,196
help Sean and Nicky
in their time of grief.

1220
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:31,593
Oh, and how is Sean's grief?

1221
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:34,366
He's... He's holding up very well.

1222
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:36,903
As-As well as can be expected.

1223
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:37,983
Uh-huh.

1224
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:40,598
Is that... everything or?

1225
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,346
Let me ask you somethin'.

1226
00:50:46,162 --> 00:50:48,836
Uh, were you aware that
he took out an extra

1227
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:52,259
$4 million life insurance
policy on Emily

1228
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:53,530
before she disappeared?

1229
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,188
I was not...

1230
00:50:57,267 --> 00:51:00,300
aware of that, no. I'm, I'm...
Why, how would I...?

1231
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,020
Okay.

1232
00:51:04,107 --> 00:51:05,131
All right.

1233
00:51:05,972 --> 00:51:07,536
Yeah. I don't...

1234
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,858
I'm sorry, I wouldn't...

1235
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:12,727
What are you...

1236
00:51:12,774 --> 00:51:14,409
Are you saying
he had her rubbed out?

1237
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:15,546
He hired a hit man?

1238
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,458
I didn't say anything about
him hiring a hit man.

1239
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:22,570
You just did.

1240
00:51:22,604 --> 00:51:24,176
Okay, I...

1241
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:27,117
can see that you're enjoying
yourself, Detective Summerville.

1242
00:51:27,142 --> 00:51:28,419
But if you wanna grill someone,

1243
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,943
you should really speak to
Emily's boss, Dennis Nylon.

1244
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,843
He could not be more suspicious.

1245
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:35,130
That's super interesting
because he contacted us.

1246
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:37,960
And he said he thought you knew
more than you were letting on.

1247
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:39,589
Well, he is...

1248
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:40,747
He sucks.

1249
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:41,671
So.

1250
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,293
As long as you're honest
with me, Miss Smothers,

1251
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:46,571
I swear to you,

1252
00:51:46,597 --> 00:51:48,654
you have nothing
to worry about, okay?

1253
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:51,552
I'm just following breadcrumbs
wherever they lead.

1254
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:53,095
Okay, you know what?

1255
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,873
I'm done for now.
Thanks for your time.

1256
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:58,688
Um... your theory doesn't
hold water, you know.

1257
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:00,483
Well, 'cause it doesn't
explain the...

1258
00:52:00,508 --> 00:52:02,301
the fake plane ticket
or the rental car.

1259
00:52:02,441 --> 00:52:04,377
And why would someone
shoot her full of heroin

1260
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:05,853
over a summer camp
in Michigan?

1261
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:08,078
There's plenty of good heroin
right here in Connecticut.

1262
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,558
I'm told.

1263
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,440
Great. Good. Okay, so we
have a lot to talk about.

1264
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,126
All right then, just relax.

1265
00:52:14,216 --> 00:52:16,589
The worst breadcrumbs
I've ever heard of, you know.

1266
00:52:16,922 --> 00:52:19,144
Couldn't fill a Caesar salad
with those breadcrumbs!

1267
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:15,384
Why is this Caesarean
salad so crunchy?

1268
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:17,341
It's Caesar salad, baby,

1269
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:19,246
and it's delicious.

1270
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:20,860
What's in it?

1271
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:22,959
Breadcrumbs.

1272
00:53:23,108 --> 00:53:23,997
Huh.

1273
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:25,679
How was your day at work?

1274
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,410
Grim.

1275
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,500
I spent most of the day
explaining the difference between

1276
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:31,453
"your" possessive and

1277
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:34,968
"you're" apostrophe r-e
to college juniors.

1278
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:38,238
I can see how that might
drive a man over the edge.

1279
00:53:39,026 --> 00:53:40,495
I know, right?

1280
00:53:40,688 --> 00:53:41,815
What about you boys?

1281
00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:44,021
What'd you guys get up to
today at school?

1282
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:45,580
I saw my mom.

1283
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:50,944
I understand, Nicky,
that sometimes

1284
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,701
we think we see
people that we miss

1285
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:55,344
even if they're gone.

1286
00:53:55,393 --> 00:53:56,878
No, I saw her.

1287
00:53:56,951 --> 00:54:00,149
She was right outside the fence
by the kickball yard at recess.

1288
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,844
Well, lots of people look like
someone else.

1289
00:54:04,102 --> 00:54:05,729
Nobody looks like Mom.

1290
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:08,389
She told me to say hi
to Stephanie.

1291
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,949
Nicky, this is unhealthy.

1292
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:13,204
Miles saw her too.
Right, Miles?

1293
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:15,835
I think I did

1294
00:54:15,947 --> 00:54:17,089
but I don't know.

1295
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:18,486
I was playing tetherball.

1296
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,121
Did you two hatch this up?

1297
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,714
Is this a game? Like when you
smash everything with trucks?

1298
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,215
'Cause you know what
we say about lying.

1299
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:25,892
I'm not lying! I saw her!

1300
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:26,973
Fuck you!

1301
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:28,154
Hey, Nicky.

1302
00:54:28,204 --> 00:54:29,323
Oopsy.

1303
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:32,391
Sorry.

1304
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:43,578
Don't I get a kiss goodnight?

1305
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:45,787
Of course you do, sweetie.

1306
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:49,741
Actually owe the oopsy jar a
quarter for earlier but I...

1307
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,291
Goodnight, sweetie.

1308
00:55:06,608 --> 00:55:07,703
Hey.

1309
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:10,354
We should get naked.

1310
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,235
What is it?

1311
00:55:15,227 --> 00:55:16,307
What's wrong?

1312
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:19,897
I smell her, Sean.
I smell her perfume.

1313
00:55:19,922 --> 00:55:21,858
It's all over Nicky
like a ghost.

1314
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,750
Probably got to a perfume
bottle in the medicine cabinet.

1315
00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:26,460
He misses her.

1316
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:28,396
And it's just you
being paranoid.

1317
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:29,489
Is it?

1318
00:55:29,514 --> 00:55:31,044
'Cause I found this, too.

1319
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:32,959
What's this?

1320
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:34,904
It's the friendship bracelet
I made her.

1321
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:37,074
Afraid to say
she would not have kept this.

1322
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,330
She hated stuff like this.

1323
00:55:39,873 --> 00:55:42,397
She probably gave it to him
right after you gave it to her.

1324
00:55:42,566 --> 00:55:44,519
Unless he's telling the truth.

1325
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:47,153
You saw her with your own eyes

1326
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,097
in her coffin.

1327
00:55:49,202 --> 00:55:50,559
There was something off.

1328
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:52,456
They found her out of
the bottom of a lake.

1329
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:53,954
You saw her tattoo,

1330
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,260
and you saw that ring that
she stole from my mother.

1331
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,365
She said your mother wanted
her to have that ring.

1332
00:56:00,454 --> 00:56:01,883
She said your mother insisted.

1333
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:03,272
That's what she told you?

1334
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:06,371
My father gave that ring
to my mother.

1335
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:08,890
It was like the only bit of
jewelry that she ever owned.

1336
00:56:08,947 --> 00:56:12,336
I took Emily to London to meet
my mother after we eloped.

1337
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:13,884
It went missing that weekend.

1338
00:56:14,986 --> 00:56:16,446
My mother was frantic.

1339
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:17,898
We searched everywhere.

1340
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:19,797
Nothing. We didn't
find a single thing.

1341
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:22,340
<i>My mother was devastated.</i>

1342
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,815
<i>So we took a flight back
to New York.</i>

1343
00:56:25,645 --> 00:56:27,050
Guess what I found.

1344
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:28,989
What did you find?

1345
00:56:30,293 --> 00:56:31,301
No!

1346
00:56:31,627 --> 00:56:33,055
No way!

1347
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,985
My little Sherlock Holmes.

1348
00:56:35,879 --> 00:56:37,768
Mum is gonna be so relieved.

1349
00:56:37,824 --> 00:56:39,411
Oh, come on, baby.

1350
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,891
Mum will take it to the grave,
what a waste.

1351
00:56:42,796 --> 00:56:43,931
So pretty.

1352
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:45,355
Excuse me.

1353
00:56:45,404 --> 00:56:48,009
Not amusing, my darling.
Not in the slightest.

1354
00:56:48,096 --> 00:56:50,168
I'm not joking in the slightest,

1355
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:52,078
my darling.

1356
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:55,597
I took it. I don't have any
intention of giving it back.

1357
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:56,922
Of course,
we're gonna give it back.

1358
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:57,962
No.

1359
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,236
Well, we'll tell her that

1360
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:01,847
it just slipped into
your purse by accident.

1361
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:03,943
and we've only found it now.

1362
00:57:04,036 --> 00:57:05,704
But if you tell her
that I found it,

1363
00:57:05,783 --> 00:57:07,361
then I have to tell
her that I stole it.

1364
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:09,433
And what do think
will be worse for her?

1365
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:11,257
Thinking that she lost her ring

1366
00:57:11,296 --> 00:57:13,844
or thinking that her son
married a thief?

1367
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,348
- Baby...
- Hey.

1368
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:18,602
You choose. Her or me.

1369
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:24,299
Meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds. Knock twice.

1370
00:57:51,128 --> 00:57:53,937
<i>Nine months later,
Nicky was born.</i>

1371
00:57:54,662 --> 00:57:56,226
<i>How could you stay with her?</i>

1372
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:57,956
I was spellbound.

1373
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:01,307
She was the only woman
I could never figure out fully.

1374
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:03,384
I was a young, arrogant writer.

1375
00:58:03,471 --> 00:58:05,273
Could never live up to
what she expected of me.

1376
00:58:05,578 --> 00:58:07,213
I was always
looking over my shoulder.

1377
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:08,658
I could hardly sleep.

1378
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,568
But with you, it's different.

1379
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:13,205
I sleep like a log.

1380
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,245
That's what every woman
wants to hear.

1381
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:16,271
You know what I mean.

1382
00:58:16,296 --> 00:58:18,129
You understand me.
You see me.

1383
00:58:18,902 --> 00:58:20,736
You've rebuilt me, Stephanie.

1384
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:22,561
I've even started writing again.

1385
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:25,344
First couple of chapters, but

1386
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,100
it's a start.

1387
00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:29,092
Oh.

1388
00:58:30,638 --> 00:58:31,900
That's wonderful.

1389
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:34,170
You took a broken man

1390
00:58:34,273 --> 00:58:36,265
and you pieced him
back together again.

1391
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:39,003
You're unlike any other
woman I've ever met.

1392
00:58:40,904 --> 00:58:42,190
Move in with me.

1393
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,272
Sean.

1394
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:46,962
No. It's too soon.
What will people think?

1395
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:48,388
They're already thinking it.

1396
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:50,832
And I'm tired of lying.
I am tired of pretending.

1397
00:58:50,896 --> 00:58:52,404
I want to be this man.

1398
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:54,104
The man I am with you.

1399
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,919
I've had two threesomes.

1400
00:58:57,287 --> 00:58:58,525
I want to say that.

1401
00:58:58,588 --> 00:58:59,937
I'll just get that out
in the open.

1402
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:01,559
What are you talking about?

1403
00:59:01,695 --> 00:59:03,028
Your TA.

1404
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,506
Emily told me about...
your little moment.

1405
00:59:06,732 --> 00:59:08,107
- That's what she told you?
- Yes.

1406
00:59:08,154 --> 00:59:09,186
Stephanie, listen...

1407
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:11,347
Emily was a pathological liar.

1408
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:12,690
That never happened.

1409
00:59:12,785 --> 00:59:13,770
Okay?

1410
00:59:14,502 --> 00:59:17,899
Why did you take out a $4 million
insurance policy on her?

1411
00:59:18,098 --> 00:59:19,146
My gosh.

1412
00:59:19,298 --> 00:59:21,086
Those cops really did a
number on you, didn't they?

1413
00:59:21,115 --> 00:59:22,076
I'm being serious.

1414
00:59:22,198 --> 00:59:23,825
It was because of you.

1415
00:59:23,912 --> 00:59:25,038
When Emily found out that

1416
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:28,126
you were living off your
husband's insurance money,

1417
00:59:28,227 --> 00:59:30,988
she thought she and I
needed to get policies out

1418
00:59:31,013 --> 00:59:32,212
for Nicky's sake.

1419
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:34,539
It was probably the most
responsible thing we ever did.

1420
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,576
Thanks to you.

1421
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:39,998
Move in with me.

1422
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:42,652
We can start a whole new,
wonderful life together,

1423
00:59:42,724 --> 00:59:44,311
just you and me
and the boys.

1424
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:47,999
Please, say yes!

1425
00:59:51,038 --> 00:59:54,093
I love you, Stephanie Smothers.

1426
00:59:55,048 --> 00:59:56,112
I love you, too.

Hi, moms.

1447
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:17,743
Stephanie here.

1448
01:01:17,912 --> 01:01:19,602
I'm gonna do something
a little different today.

1449
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:22,334
I normally avoid any talk
of religion on the vlog.

1450
01:01:22,406 --> 01:01:24,811
I don't want to offend any
non-denominational moms.

1451
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:28,202
But I do think that we
live on after we die. So.

1452
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:31,428
Emily,

1453
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,381
<i>if you're out there,</i>

1454
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:35,936
<i>and you can
hear me right now,</i>

1455
01:01:36,462 --> 01:01:38,147
<i>no one could ever replace you.</i>

1456
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:40,599
<i>And you'll always be
Nicky's mom.</i>

1457
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:43,498
<i>I can't take your place.</i>

1458
01:01:43,994 --> 01:01:45,907
<i>I can...</i>

1459
01:01:46,065 --> 01:01:48,010
<i>just try to love the people
that you love</i>

1460
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:49,757
<i>and try to make
their lives better.</i>

1461
01:01:50,777 --> 01:01:52,618
<i>I think that's what
you would want.</i>

1462
01:01:57,428 --> 01:01:59,301
Okay, guys, it's getting
too rough back there.

1463
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:01,303
I murdered you!

1464
01:02:01,623 --> 01:02:04,274
Not me.
I came back to life.

1465
01:02:04,563 --> 01:02:05,619
Like your mom.

1466
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,405
Okay! The dolls a going
in your backpack

1467
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:09,095
or they're going in
the trash. I mean it.

1468
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:12,370
Mom, they're not dolls! God!

1469
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:15,132
Stephanie, my mom
told me to give you this.

1470
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:17,520
Mom!

1471
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:26,670
Damn, are you
trying to kill us?!

1472
01:02:46,424 --> 01:02:47,416
Hello?

1473
01:02:47,471 --> 01:02:50,156
<i>Hi! I'm calling from United
Timeshare International.</i>

1474
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:51,037
Yup.

1475
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:52,911
<i>We'd like to offer you a
free trip to the Bahamas.</i>

1476
01:02:53,038 --> 01:02:53,815
<i>- All you have to do is</i>
- I don't...

1477
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,720
<i>come down to one of our</i>

1478
01:02:54,745 --> 01:02:56,514
I don't want that.
I'm so... I, I...

1479
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,627
Have a nice day.  I don't
want that. I don't care.

1480
01:02:59,092 --> 01:03:00,457
Oh, my God.

1481
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:06,211
Hi, I'm sure you
have a job to do.

1482
01:03:06,236 --> 01:03:07,219
I don't need a free trip...

1483
01:03:07,244 --> 01:03:08,251
<i>Hi.</i>

1484
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:12,123
<i>Brother fucker.</i>

1485
01:03:15,023 --> 01:03:16,031
Emily?

1486
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:17,809
<i>No, no, no. Emily's dead.</i>

1487
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,152
<i>Oh, have you forgotten already?</i>

1488
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:21,273
Where are you?

1489
01:03:21,328 --> 01:03:23,312
<i>I'm in heaven
watching over you.</i>

1490
01:03:24,283 --> 01:03:25,711
<i>Nice blouse, by the way.</i>

1491
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:29,637
Why are you doing this?

1492
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,288
<i>How do you know
it's just me doing it?</i>

1493
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:32,513
<i>Hey, hey, hey...</i>

1494
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:34,553
<i>kiss Sean for me</i>

1495
01:03:34,695 --> 01:03:36,275
<i>four million times.</i>

1496
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:42,815
Oh, hey.

1497
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:44,506
Are you trying to <i>Diabolique</i> me?

1498
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:46,106
What are you talking about?

1499
01:03:46,161 --> 01:03:48,208
<i>Diabolique</i>, you know,
the, the,

1500
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:49,839
the French movie about the guy

1501
01:03:49,878 --> 01:03:51,721
whose wife and mistress..
they're trying to kill him...

1502
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,976
but I don't have a
$4 million insurance policy...

1503
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:55,583
- Stephanie...
- If you and Emily

1504
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:56,885
- are in some kind of plan,
- Stephanie, relax.

1505
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,925
- please just call it off.
- Stephanie.

1506
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,054
I'm really not the one.

1507
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:00,533
Just breathe, please.

1508
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,036
Nicky's getting to you.
Emily is dead.

1509
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,377
She called me.

1510
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:06,382
What?

1511
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:07,972
She called me today.

1512
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:09,607
I have a friend in the
psychology department,

1513
01:04:09,655 --> 01:04:10,710
I'll give him a call...

1514
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:11,901
Hey, handsome, you got time...?

1515
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,726
I... am sorry.

1516
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:15,226
I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

1517
01:04:15,317 --> 01:04:16,626
Beth, this is Stephanie.

1518
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:18,003
Nice to meet you.

1519
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,465
Nice to meet you.

1520
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:22,638
Uh, I was just wondering if you
needed to use the smart board

1521
01:04:22,686 --> 01:04:23,742
'cause it's broken.

1522
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:25,015
I can live without it.

1523
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:25,984
Okay.

1524
01:04:26,707 --> 01:04:27,636
Right.

1525
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,919
She seems nice.

1526
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:32,396
Stephanie, go home.

1527
01:04:32,926 --> 01:04:35,204
Emily had some Xanax in the
medicine cabinet. Take one.

1528
01:04:35,229 --> 01:04:36,112
Take two.

1529
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:37,046
Yeah.

1530
01:04:37,071 --> 01:04:38,810
Maybe she had some
heroin lying around, hmm?

1531
01:04:38,898 --> 01:04:39,954
This is all just grief.

1532
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:41,591
Just stages of grief.

1533
01:04:42,287 --> 01:04:44,287
I'm sorry. You're right, I...

1534
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:45,922
I'm so overwhelmed and I...

1535
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,553
I'm so sorry.

1536
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:56,084
<i>Oh, baby, you just need
someone to love you.</i>

1537
01:04:57,325 --> 01:04:58,627
I have you.

1538
01:04:59,011 --> 01:05:00,678
I could use a good friend.

1539
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:02,519
Come on, don't you miss sex?

1540
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:05,197
Having men fuck you on top
of a washing machine?

1541
01:05:06,477 --> 01:05:08,143
I barely remember what it's like.

1542
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:09,662
Why are you being
such a masochist?

1543
01:05:09,702 --> 01:05:11,249
You can have a man in your
bed any time you want.

1544
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:13,274
I had a man.
I ruined that, so.

1545
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:14,345
What does that mean?

1546
01:05:14,436 --> 01:05:15,690
Come on, what does that mean?

1547
01:05:15,754 --> 01:05:16,698
Nah.

1548
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,954
If you can't tell me,
y-you can't tell anyone.

1549
01:05:19,025 --> 01:05:20,073
I'm your best friend.

1550
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,121
My-My brother Chris?
I don't...

1551
01:05:24,227 --> 01:05:25,481
Yeah, your brother.

1552
01:05:25,974 --> 01:05:28,133
You certainly don't act like it.

1553
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:31,383
Sometimes it's more like
you guys are lovers, right?

1554
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:35,221
That's... disgusting. That's...

1555
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:36,721
Is Miles mine or not?

1556
01:05:37,106 --> 01:05:39,209
Ah... Ah...

1557
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,582
Oh, my God!

1558
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,531
Are you hear... are you
listening to yourself?

1559
01:05:42,586 --> 01:05:43,927
You sound ridiculous.

1560
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:44,970
Yeah.

1561
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:53,261
<i>Davis?</i>

1562
01:05:53,857 --> 01:05:54,896
<i>Davis?</i>

1563
01:05:55,257 --> 01:05:56,599
Where you going?

1564
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:58,529
Da... where are you going?
Davis?

1565
01:05:58,592 --> 01:05:59,791
Steph, it's all right, don't worry.

1566
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:02,984
Just gonna go for drive,
have a little talk, man to man.

1567
01:06:03,065 --> 01:06:04,136
No problem.

1568
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:26,040
<i>It's my fault.</i>

1569
01:06:28,346 --> 01:06:29,846
I'm the reason they're both dead.

1570
01:06:29,909 --> 01:06:30,845
No.

1571
01:06:31,731 --> 01:06:33,295
Hey, don't do that.

1572
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:37,171
People-People do terrible things
for their own fucked up reasons.

1573
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,012
That's on them,
that's not on you.

1574
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,688
I miss him.

1575
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:45,053
Which one?

1576
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:48,153
Both.

1577
01:06:49,641 --> 01:06:52,197
I'm... lonely.

1578
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:56,954
I think loneliness probably kills
more people than cancer.

1579
01:06:59,971 --> 01:07:01,019
Hey.

1580
01:07:01,277 --> 01:07:02,300
Come here.

1581
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:05,088
Come here.

1582
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:22,648
You're okay.

1583
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:24,204
Wanna order a pizza?

1584
01:07:30,269 --> 01:07:32,023
God, I'm so embarrassed.

1585
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,838
Oh, 'cause of that? No, hey.

1586
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:37,004
It's all good, baby.

1587
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:39,452
It's all good,
just another Tuesday.

Diana Hyland?

1603
01:08:26,257 --> 01:08:27,979
Did you paint this?

1604
01:08:40,225 --> 01:08:41,629
Where on earth
did you find it?

1605
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,256
I should start by giving
you some unfortunate news.

1606
01:08:45,856 --> 01:08:47,213
Emily is dead.

1607
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:49,285
My condolences.

1608
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:51,166
Who the fuck is Emily?

1609
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:53,317
The girl in the painting.

1610
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:57,425
Good.

1611
01:08:57,702 --> 01:09:00,496
Her name's not Emily.
Her name's Claudia.

1612
01:09:01,531 --> 01:09:03,644
Rest in peace, asshole.

1613
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,867
So, not a pleasant memory
for you, then?

1614
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,472
No, opposite. She was amazing.

1615
01:09:08,737 --> 01:09:09,895
I mean,

1616
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:11,792
she was the best
that I ever had.

1617
01:09:11,895 --> 01:09:13,237
I was selling
paintings, you know.

1618
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,652
It was the first time in my
career that I had any buzz.

1619
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,538
She walked into my gallery.

1620
01:09:18,665 --> 01:09:21,189
A real fucking muse
just right out of thin air.

1621
01:09:21,358 --> 01:09:22,564
What happened?

1622
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:23,929
She was all I could paint.

1623
01:09:25,505 --> 01:09:27,497
<i>I memorized
every inch of her body.</i>

1624
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:29,350
<i>My dealer fuckin' hated it.</i>

1625
01:09:29,422 --> 01:09:31,295
<i>And the art critics
fuckin' hated it.</i>

1626
01:09:31,343 --> 01:09:33,970
<i>They called me a knock-off
dyke Mapplethorpe.</i>

1627
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:37,489
<i>Anyway, I blew my whole career
painting that con artist.</i>

1628
01:09:37,596 --> 01:09:39,080
Now all I paint are these...

1629
01:09:39,311 --> 01:09:40,643
goddamn knives
which are pretty good

1630
01:09:40,668 --> 01:09:42,334
but nobody wants
to buy the shit.

1631
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:45,513
What? They're so good.
People are just jealous.

1632
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:50,931
I haven't had a drink
in 42 days.

1633
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:52,090
Oh, don't...

1634
01:09:52,185 --> 01:09:53,550
Might as well celebrate.

1635
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:55,211
Mm, well...

1636
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:56,857
Cheers.

1637
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:01,916
I gave her my heart
and I gave her my soul.

1638
01:10:02,659 --> 01:10:04,757
I paid for her

1639
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:06,254
to go to college.

1640
01:10:06,345 --> 01:10:07,718
I paid off her debts.

1641
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:09,657
Did you ever see
any heroin use?

1642
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:11,974
No. No way. Her?

1643
01:10:12,073 --> 01:10:13,525
No she didn't touch it.

1644
01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:14,760
Shit.

1645
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:18,178
She never let me paint her
face except for this one.

1646
01:10:18,606 --> 01:10:21,733
I've never seen
such a beautiful girl

1647
01:10:21,758 --> 01:10:23,219
want to be so invisible

1648
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:25,521
or just completely vanish.

1649
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,425
But you know what, it takes
money to vanish.

1650
01:10:28,464 --> 01:10:32,170
And so she took everything
that she could from me.

1651
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,731
You know, I oughta paint you.

1652
01:10:38,077 --> 01:10:39,600
Beatific.

1653
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:41,871
Like a-Like a fucking saint.

1654
01:10:42,407 --> 01:10:43,918
I get that a lot.

1655
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:46,916
You should embrace it.
People love saints.

1656
01:10:47,795 --> 01:10:48,779
Yeah.

1657
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:50,351
After they're dead.

1658
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:53,939
Okay, what do you know
about her? How'd she die?

1659
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:55,384
In a lake.

1660
01:10:56,296 --> 01:10:57,582
And heroin.

1661
01:11:00,653 --> 01:11:02,716
Well, you don't believe that
or you wouldn't be here.

1662
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:05,851
She didn't ever mention
Michigan, did she?

1663
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:15,509
That's the only thing
that she ever left here.

1664
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:18,322
She said she had it
since she was a kid.

1665
01:11:21,247 --> 01:11:22,350
I warn you.

1666
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,220
You go pokin' around
in her past,

1667
01:11:24,276 --> 01:11:27,237
you're gonna find some
shit that is terrifying.

1668
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:30,070
She was not a normal person
like you or me.

1669
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:32,337
Sean, it's Stephanie.

1670
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:34,067
I thought about
what you said and

1671
01:11:34,162 --> 01:11:35,195
<i>you're right.</i>

1672
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:36,722
<i>These are just stages of grief.</i>

1673
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:39,249
<i>This experience has been
so stressful for both of us.</i>

1674
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:40,990
<i>I'm gonna take
a couple of days to myself.</i>

1675
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:42,183
<i>I'll have Sona pick up the boys</i>

1676
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:43,771
<i>and they can stay
at her house tonight.</i>

1677
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:45,493
<i>You should take some time too.</i>

1678
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,924
<i>There's ham stew in the freezer.
Five minutes in the microwave.</i>

1679
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,075
<i>Lots of love.</i>

1680
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:54,596
We've been saving young souls
going on 50 years now.

1681
01:11:54,814 --> 01:11:56,131
Not Bobby and me personally.

1682
01:11:56,715 --> 01:11:58,413
Well, it seems just perfect.

1683
01:11:58,501 --> 01:11:59,731
And my son's practically
a porpoise,

1684
01:11:59,756 --> 01:12:01,731
so I know he's gonna love
swimming in that pond.

1685
01:12:01,799 --> 01:12:03,426
Oh, that's Squaw Lake.

1686
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:05,268
The kids all joke
that it's holy water.

1687
01:12:06,048 --> 01:12:07,261
Any fish you pull out of there

1688
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:09,000
is guaranteed
to feed a multitude.

1689
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:11,514
- Oh, that's so funny.
- Yeah.

1690
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:15,463
Um, have you guys got uh,
any old photo albums

1691
01:12:15,496 --> 01:12:17,799
or a yearbook I could look at?

1692
01:12:17,824 --> 01:12:19,688
I always feel like there's
no better review of a place

1693
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,324
than the faces of the campers.

1694
01:12:21,365 --> 01:12:23,882
Oh, heck, yeah. We got a ton
of them down in the basement.

1695
01:12:23,915 --> 01:12:25,503
You'll see nothin' but smiles.

1696
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:49,768
Hope and Faith.

1697
01:12:53,233 --> 01:12:56,804
<i>Hi, uh, I'm looking for the
McLanden Foundation.</i>

1698
01:12:57,007 --> 01:12:58,538
<i>Is this Margaret McLanden?</i>

1699
01:12:58,673 --> 01:12:59,642
<i>Who's this?</i>

1700
01:12:59,692 --> 01:13:01,502
Uh, yeah, hi there.

1701
01:13:01,693 --> 01:13:03,471
My name's Maryann Chelkowsky.

1702
01:13:03,514 --> 01:13:05,966
I'm the director of the
Squaw Lake Bible Camp.

1703
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:06,945
<i>What do you want?</i>

1704
01:13:06,987 --> 01:13:08,399
Well, we are putting together

1705
01:13:08,424 --> 01:13:11,233
the 50th anniversary edition
of our camp gazette.

1706
01:13:11,293 --> 01:13:13,261
We're trying to track down
some star alumni.

1707
01:13:13,296 --> 01:13:16,542
Are you any relation to
Hope and Faith McLanden?

1708
01:13:16,663 --> 01:13:18,663
<i> - Hello?
- Bruce, it's that camp.</i>

1709
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,971
<i>The girls must have done
something again, and God...</i>

1710
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,115
<i>The girls are long gone, Mrs. M,</i>

1711
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,902
<i>you just go on
back in your chair.</i>

1712
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:25,835
<i>It's filthy in that roost...</i>

1713
01:13:26,586 --> 01:13:27,764
Gotcha.

1714
01:14:11,332 --> 01:14:12,848
Take your time, Bruce.

1715
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:36,168
Mrs. McLanden?

1716
01:14:37,815 --> 01:14:39,894
Hi, I'm Gloria
from the cleaning service.

1717
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:41,031
Who?

1718
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:43,611
Didn't Bruce tell you? I'm
supposed to clean the entire place

1719
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:46,248
until you could eat a
four-course meal off the floor.

1720
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:47,705
Did I get the date...?

1721
01:14:48,176 --> 01:14:49,176
Shoot.

1722
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,800
Start in my upstairs bathroom.

1723
01:15:00,648 --> 01:15:02,489
It's not lying
if I'm actually cleaning.

1724
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:22,916
Bruce, the fire's dying!

1725
01:15:24,237 --> 01:15:25,231
Bruce!

1726
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:41,986
I couldn't help noticing that

1727
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:43,882
lovely picture of your daughters.

1728
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:45,167
Where...?

1729
01:15:45,888 --> 01:15:47,142
Where's Bruce?

1730
01:15:47,247 --> 01:15:48,604
- Bruce?
- Oh, um...

1731
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:50,739
Bruce had to go out, um.

1732
01:15:51,115 --> 01:15:52,376
So...

1733
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,545
Your daughter Faith,

1734
01:15:54,601 --> 01:15:56,958
- she had some trouble, I gather.
- Troubles.

1735
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,477
Troubles would have been
a vacation.

1736
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:05,302
No, that child came
straight from hell.

1737
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:08,291
That's a very strong statement
for a mother.

1738
01:16:08,367 --> 01:16:09,645
Are you a mother?

1739
01:16:09,844 --> 01:16:10,844
Yes.

1740
01:16:11,385 --> 01:16:13,075
I love every minute of it.

1741
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:14,280
Aww.

1742
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:16,700
Then you must have
brain damage.

1743
01:16:17,264 --> 01:16:18,843
It's a thankless business.

1744
01:16:18,918 --> 01:16:21,671
And some children are just
born rotten.

1745
01:16:22,065 --> 01:16:23,676
They don't need a parent.

1746
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:25,224
They need an exorcist.

1747
01:16:25,656 --> 01:16:27,632
My husband understood that.

1748
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,540
Just, oh, no, wait. Don't...
Don't tell Bruce.

1749
01:16:31,603 --> 01:16:33,040
- No.
- Bingo!

1750
01:16:33,695 --> 01:16:36,767
It's unseemly the way
that man polices me.

1751
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:38,591
Would you like some sherry?

1752
01:16:38,688 --> 01:16:40,522
Oh, no, thank you.
You're very sweet.

1753
01:16:40,587 --> 01:16:41,936
Wait, that's...

1754
01:16:42,588 --> 01:16:45,439
That's not sherry,
that's the gin.

1755
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:46,934
Where's the sherry?

1756
01:16:46,973 --> 01:16:48,608
Must be behind the Sylvia Plath...

1757
01:16:48,648 --> 01:16:50,450
What ever happened to Faith?

1758
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:52,378
Oh, everything, everything.

1759
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:55,142
We spent so much money
on her rehab.

1760
01:16:56,055 --> 01:16:57,264
Which helped her, it did...

1761
01:16:57,336 --> 01:16:59,443
helped take care of her.
Get her...

1762
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:01,629
off that stuff.

1763
01:17:01,737 --> 01:17:03,253
Whereas Hope's a born liar.

1764
01:17:03,324 --> 01:17:04,840
Terrible posture.

1765
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:07,368
Mrs. McLanden, do you...

1766
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:10,162
Do you know the person
in this photograph?

1767
01:17:12,406 --> 01:17:13,628
That's Faith.

1768
01:17:14,517 --> 01:17:15,444
That's Faith!

1769
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:17,462
Now, why you-why you...
Did she send you?

1770
01:17:17,487 --> 01:17:18,361
No, I'm not even sure...

1771
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:19,323
Are you the police?

1772
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:20,171
No, I'm just asking.

1773
01:17:20,196 --> 01:17:22,274
I have told you people
a thousand times.

1774
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:23,996
My memory
is not good anymore.

1775
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:25,948
Will not stand up in court.

1776
01:17:26,027 --> 01:17:27,273
The night of that fire,

1777
01:17:27,352 --> 01:17:28,979
my husband and I
were estranged.

1778
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:30,884
We lived in separate wings
of the house.

1779
01:17:30,995 --> 01:17:33,217
The-The fire that
burned down the west wing?

1780
01:17:33,743 --> 01:17:35,298
Are you an insurance agent?

1781
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:37,246
Yes.

1782
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:38,534
Oh.

1783
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,082
Oh, good.

1784
01:17:40,217 --> 01:17:41,677
Oh, good, good.

1785
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:44,687
Bruce and I have been waiting
for the insurance money.

1786
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:45,945
Of course,

1787
01:17:46,072 --> 01:17:48,525
you assholes had that
clause about arson.

1788
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:50,282
- Right, arson, yeah.
- Vultures!

1789
01:17:50,705 --> 01:17:52,017
Here's to being house poor.

1790
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,549
You ain't supposed to
be drinkin', Mrs. M.

1791
01:17:54,574 --> 01:17:55,448
Who're you?

1792
01:17:55,473 --> 01:17:58,879
Well! Uh, thank you so much
for your time, Mrs. McLanden.

1793
01:17:58,904 --> 01:17:59,956
I will get you that

1794
01:17:59,981 --> 01:18:02,361
faux Givenchy suit
in ivory and the

1795
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,723
scarf in taupe.

1796
01:18:03,748 --> 01:18:05,136
I will put a rush on it!

1797
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:06,606
Thank you for your order!

1798
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:47,078
Where do you think
you're goin'?

1799
01:18:48,715 --> 01:18:51,445
I wanted to order
the navy blazer.

1800
01:18:52,322 --> 01:18:53,870
Extra large.

1801
01:18:54,433 --> 01:18:55,282
Great.

1802
01:19:01,322 --> 01:19:02,226
Hello.

1803
01:19:02,314 --> 01:19:03,822
What do you want, cupcake?

1804
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:05,277
I'm looking for all the

1805
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:07,286
Wayne County arson-related
news items

1806
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:08,619
for the last 20 years.

1807
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:20,173
<i>Hi, moms. Stephanie here.</i>

1808
01:19:20,414 --> 01:19:22,453
<i>I'm coming to you from Michigan.</i>

1809
01:19:22,956 --> 01:19:24,749
<i>Special on-the-road edition.</i>

1810
01:19:27,373 --> 01:19:28,739
<i>As many of you know,</i>

1811
01:19:28,794 --> 01:19:30,287
<i>I was struggling to find closure</i>

1812
01:19:30,318 --> 01:19:32,453
<i>surrounding the death
of my best friend.</i>

1813
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:35,052
<i>So I drove up to the lake
 where she drowned</i>

1814
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,600
<i>to see if I could...</i>

1815
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,348
<i>dredge something up.</i>

1816
01:19:39,663 --> 01:19:40,758
Oh, shit.

1817
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:41,829
<i>Well, it turns out,</i>

1818
01:19:41,885 --> 01:19:43,870
this is the site of many
a canoe race

1819
01:19:43,895 --> 01:19:45,988
at the Squaw Lake
Bible Camp.

1820
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:48,637
<i>I had to dig through
a bunch of camp journals.</i>

1821
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:51,605
<i>And I found...
a photo of Emily</i>

1822
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:54,256
<i>whose middle name is Claudia.</i>

1823
01:19:54,441 --> 01:19:55,973
<i>In't that pretty?
I didn't know that.</i>

1824
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:58,690
You crazy fucking bitch.

1825
01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:01,432
It's like looking at an angel,
isn't it, moms?

1826
01:20:01,566 --> 01:20:03,209
Brother fucker.

1827
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:05,320
And it gave me
the closure I needed.

1828
01:20:05,538 --> 01:20:07,627
<i>I feel closer to Emily
than I've ever felt.</i>

1829
01:20:07,714 --> 01:20:09,262
<i>Almost like a twin.</i>

1830
01:20:09,741 --> 01:20:11,447
Emily, wherever you are,

1831
01:20:13,004 --> 01:20:14,599
I hope...

1832
01:20:14,734 --> 01:20:16,139
that you're listening.

1833
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:18,319
You gotta have faith.

1834
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:21,586

Oh, smoochy-smooch.

1852
01:20:53,428 --> 01:20:55,848
Oh, my goodness, smooch!
I missed you so much.

1853
01:20:55,873 --> 01:20:56,897
Mmm-mwah!

1854
01:20:56,922 --> 01:20:57,941
Where were you?

1855
01:20:57,966 --> 01:21:00,251
and why did we have to
sleep at Hector's house?

1856
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:01,520
He pees the bed!

1857
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:03,564
Oh! Hector's the worst!

1858
01:21:03,783 --> 01:21:05,251
You couldn't stay with me, huh?

1859
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:08,394
I thought we all
needed a breather.

1860
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,120
Now, I feel like a million bucks.

1861
01:21:10,684 --> 01:21:11,906
Maybe even four.

1862
01:21:15,462 --> 01:21:17,049
Hi, my name is Beth.

1863
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:19,167
I'm calling on behalf of
my boss, Sean Townsend,

1864
01:21:19,192 --> 01:21:21,213
about his wife,
Emily Nelson's policy.

1865
01:21:21,356 --> 01:21:26,625
Number is CT-7602258001.

1866
01:21:26,822 --> 01:21:28,012
Can you tell me the
name of the agent

1867
01:21:28,037 --> 01:21:29,140
who handles that
account, please?

1868
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:30,302
<i>Dear Ms. Praeger,</i>

1869
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,580
<i>My name is Bruce Hargrave</i>

1870
01:21:31,605 --> 01:21:33,232
<i>I'm writing to you about
a case you're handling</i>

1871
01:21:33,295 --> 01:21:35,168
<i>for Emily Nelson,
recently deceased.</i>

1872
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:38,084
<i>I've been the caretaker of her
family estate for many years.</i>

1873
01:21:38,112 --> 01:21:40,183
<i>What I have to say will
sound crazy, but years ago,</i>

1874
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:41,885
<i>my employer died
in a house fire.</i>

1875
01:21:41,933 --> 01:21:43,559
<i>His teen daughters,
Hope and Faith McLanden,</i>

1876
01:21:43,584 --> 01:21:44,973
<i>disappeared without a trace.</i>

1877
01:21:46,018 --> 01:21:47,557
Hi, this is Sean Townsend,

1878
01:21:47,626 --> 01:21:49,224
I was meant to meet
Billy Kane for lunch.

1879
01:21:50,777 --> 01:21:51,864
What do you mean?

1880
01:21:52,214 --> 01:21:54,515
You guys two days ago
to organize this.

1881
01:21:58,817 --> 01:22:00,015
No, never mind.

1882
01:22:00,277 --> 01:22:01,468
I'll call him back.

1883
01:22:02,309 --> 01:22:03,230
Boo.

1884
01:22:08,677 --> 01:22:10,119
Oh, c'mon,
you knew that, for sure.

1885
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:11,381
We spent every
anniversary here.

1886
01:22:11,441 --> 01:22:12,931
How could you not
put it together?

1887
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:14,518
Emily, why?

1888
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:16,293
I have four million reasons why.

1889
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,007
How could you do this to Nicky?

1890
01:22:18,186 --> 01:22:19,662
I did this for Nicky.

1891
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:21,750
I hated that job.
I never got to see him.

1892
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:23,624
It's not like we could
live off your faculty buffet

1893
01:22:23,649 --> 01:22:25,278
the rest of our lives,
could we?

1894
01:22:25,453 --> 01:22:27,009
I grieved your death.

1895
01:22:27,131 --> 01:22:28,409
I understand.

1896
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:30,269
Y-You're not alone.

1897
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:33,087
They say that 90% of people
who lose their spouse

1898
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:35,320
end up sleeping with their
spouse's best friend.

1899
01:22:35,345 --> 01:22:37,117
After their funeral, actually.

1900
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:38,093
Really?

1901
01:22:38,136 --> 01:22:40,803
No, I just made the up,
you fucking dick.

1902
01:22:41,237 --> 01:22:42,625
That's how you grieve?

1903
01:22:42,752 --> 01:22:44,657
Balls deep in my best friend?

1904
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:45,858
You could've told me something.

1905
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:47,811
Except you can't keep a
secret even in the dark.

1906
01:22:47,836 --> 01:22:49,502
- Anything.
- You almost ruined everything.

1907
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:54,745
I had to lay low until the
insurance money came through.

1908
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,678
And so, why didn't you
stay low, hmm?

1909
01:22:57,782 --> 01:22:59,901
Instead, you terrorized our son.

1910
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,389
- I didn't terrorize him.
- It made me think that

1911
01:23:01,414 --> 01:23:03,937
he had gone insane
as well as Stephanie.

1912
01:23:04,362 --> 01:23:05,926
I missed him too much.

1913
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:07,791
He's our little dude.

1914
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,284
You know how much
I love that kid.

1915
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:13,710
Well, the clock is ticking now.

1916
01:23:13,766 --> 01:23:15,488
Nancy Drew knows too much.

1917
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:17,907
If she fucks up my insurance
money coming through,

1918
01:23:17,986 --> 01:23:19,645
I'm taking you down with me.

1919
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:20,825
You're taking me down...

1920
01:23:20,856 --> 01:23:22,555
Well, of course, this was
all your plan.

1921
01:23:22,714 --> 01:23:23,737
My plan?

1922
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:25,121
I had nothing to do

1923
01:23:25,146 --> 01:23:26,654
- with it, you twisted,
- Why are you playing dumb, now?

1924
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:27,963
fucking psycho.

1925
01:23:28,187 --> 01:23:29,243
I don't know where...

1926
01:23:32,311 --> 01:23:34,628
What were you saying about
me being a fucking psycho?

1927
01:23:35,537 --> 01:23:36,743
Do you love her?

1928
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:37,815
No.

1929
01:23:38,017 --> 01:23:39,279
It was just sex.

1930
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:41,652
Did you think of me
while you were fucking her?

1931
01:23:42,295 --> 01:23:43,343
Yes.

1932
01:23:45,867 --> 01:23:47,447
Do you love me or not, baby?

1933
01:23:47,645 --> 01:23:49,201
Of course, I do.

1934
01:23:49,419 --> 01:23:50,895
She doesn't mean
a thing to me.

1935
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:52,094
Good.

1936
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,082
Oh, my G...

1937
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:57,256
Oh, sh... oh, shit,
I forgot to load it.

1938
01:23:57,457 --> 01:23:59,013
Fuck. Oh, God.

1939
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:01,068
Can you imagine
if it was, though?

1940
01:24:01,223 --> 01:24:02,461
What a mess.

1941
01:24:02,548 --> 01:24:03,992
Emily, you're crazy.

1942
01:24:04,218 --> 01:24:06,584
Hey, it's pretty simple,
you know?

1943
01:24:06,718 --> 01:24:08,750
It's your choice.
Her or me.

1944
01:24:09,475 --> 01:24:10,507
It's not that hard.

1945
01:24:12,521 --> 01:24:13,449
Hey.

1946
01:24:14,116 --> 01:24:15,203
Stop it.

1947
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:16,727
You love this.

1948
01:24:17,608 --> 01:24:19,695
Meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds.

1949
01:24:21,822 --> 01:24:23,061
Knock twice.

1950
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,135
Oh, Mr. Townsend.

1951
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,087
Isabel Praeger,
Addison First Insurance.

1952
01:24:41,332 --> 01:24:43,975
I'm investigating the death
benefit claim for your late wife.

1953
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:48,846
Sean...

1954
01:24:50,037 --> 01:24:52,069
Did you know that
Emily had a twin?

1955
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:56,123
No, but...

1956
01:24:56,203 --> 01:24:57,870
Well, I hate to even say this,

1957
01:24:57,933 --> 01:25:00,100
but it means the body
in the lake could be

1958
01:25:00,168 --> 01:25:01,417
this sister.

1959
01:25:01,494 --> 01:25:03,041
It could explain the DNA match.

1960
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:05,181
And if that's the case, then...

1961
01:25:05,482 --> 01:25:06,800
where is Emily?

1962
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:13,571
Well, if my wife were still
alive, she'd come home.

1963
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,029
She'd want to see her son.

1964
01:25:17,505 --> 01:25:18,680
I'm not a cop

1965
01:25:18,711 --> 01:25:20,504
and I'm definitely no therapist.

1966
01:25:20,529 --> 01:25:21,886
I'm just an insurance guy.

1967
01:25:22,906 --> 01:25:25,771
But this is an incredibly
interesting case.

1968
01:25:25,909 --> 01:25:27,640
This is just bananas, isn't it?

1969
01:25:28,293 --> 01:25:29,959
- Yeah.
- I will say...

1970
01:25:30,071 --> 01:25:31,717
It's unusual

1971
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:33,273
to live with someone
as husband and wife

1972
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:34,734
and not know
that they have a twin.

1973
01:25:34,774 --> 01:25:36,472
She was a very private person.

1974
01:25:36,588 --> 01:25:37,803
Well, hey,

1975
01:25:37,914 --> 01:25:39,660
we all have our secrets.

1976
01:25:41,672 --> 01:25:43,434
But, as I'm sure
you can understand,

1977
01:25:43,459 --> 01:25:44,716
with a payment of this size,

1978
01:25:44,768 --> 01:25:47,093
we'll have to continue
this claims investigation.

1979
01:25:47,187 --> 01:25:49,203
- Of course.
- And by law,

1980
01:25:49,515 --> 01:25:51,538
give all our findings
to the authorities.

1981
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,104
Of course, anything you need.

1982
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:55,256
I just hope that
my wife is still alive.

1983
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:56,780
I want her back.

1984
01:26:00,596 --> 01:26:01,779
Okie-dokie, then.

1985
01:26:02,036 --> 01:26:03,964
Obviously,
if you hear from her...

1986
01:26:04,051 --> 01:26:05,218
You'd be the first to know.

1987
01:26:05,259 --> 01:26:06,649
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, thank you.

1988
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:07,855
Thanks for the coffee.

1989
01:26:09,312 --> 01:26:11,148
Buh-bye, thank you
so much again.

1990
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:14,387
You knew that she had a twin.

1991
01:26:14,498 --> 01:26:15,546
Did I?

1992
01:26:15,705 --> 01:26:17,085
Why didn't you?

1993
01:26:17,257 --> 01:26:18,669
You knew
and you didn't tell me.

1994
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:19,852
Sean.

1995
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:22,054
You sound crazy.

1996
01:26:22,172 --> 01:26:23,188
Uh...

1997
01:26:23,513 --> 01:26:24,870
Take a Xanax.

1998
01:26:25,645 --> 01:26:26,629
Take two.

1999
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:29,148
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

2000
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:31,626
Today, we're talking about
tombstone tributes.

2001
01:26:31,659 --> 01:26:33,272
I want to thank Helen,
from Missoula, Montana

2002
01:26:33,297 --> 01:26:35,908
for the suggestions,
for thinking outside the box.

2003
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:37,652
<i>You know,</i>

2004
01:26:37,677 --> 01:26:40,082
<i>it doesn't have to just
be flowers anymore.</i>

2005
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:41,939
<i>I think any</i>

2006
01:26:42,005 --> 01:26:45,342
<i>item that sparks a fond
memory is-is perfect.</i>

2007
01:26:45,509 --> 01:26:47,192
<i>Now, Emily's favorite treat was</i>

2008
01:26:47,247 --> 01:26:49,406
<i>a dry gin martini
in the late afternoon.</i>

2009
01:26:49,647 --> 01:26:52,005
<i>I'm gonna make a couple
just like Emily used to.</i>

2010
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:53,684
<i>Frozen gin.</i>

2011
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:54,977
<i>Frozen glass.</i>

2012
01:26:55,105 --> 01:26:56,454
<i>Generous twist.</i>

2013
01:26:56,927 --> 01:26:58,880
<i>Gonna head out there
a little later today.</i>

2014
01:26:59,962 --> 01:27:01,454
<i>Have a toast on her grave.</i>

2015
01:27:05,731 --> 01:27:08,008
Nice big twist,
I taught you well.

2016
01:27:08,874 --> 01:27:10,573
Student become the master?

2017
01:27:10,822 --> 01:27:11,751
Oh.

2018
01:27:12,108 --> 01:27:13,184
Waste of time.

2019
01:27:14,489 --> 01:27:15,640
Hey, give me that.

2020
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:17,638
I don't know what
tricks you have

2021
01:27:17,663 --> 01:27:19,519
up those new sleeves of yours.

2022
01:27:20,071 --> 01:27:22,824
You think I poisoned both drinks?
That's not my style.

2023
01:27:23,494 --> 01:27:24,977
I don't even eat gluten.

2024
01:27:28,305 --> 01:27:29,931
- Want another?
- Please.

2025
01:27:31,564 --> 01:27:34,112
First, tell me why you killed
your father and sister.

2026
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:37,132
Okay, why don't we first talk
about your son's real father.

2027
01:27:37,219 --> 01:27:39,976
Oh, Emily, I hold
all the cards here.

2028
01:27:40,056 --> 01:27:41,548
I want to know about
your twin, Faith.

2029
01:27:41,606 --> 01:27:42,756
I'm not a twin.

2030
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:44,403
Great, uh, I know that you are.

2031
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:45,904
We were triplets.

2032
01:27:46,142 --> 01:27:48,403
Faith, Hope and Charity.
Charity was stillborn.

2033
01:27:48,487 --> 01:27:50,257
Mom thought we offed her
in the womb.

2034
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:52,045
- Hmm.
- Dad believed her.

2035
01:27:52,912 --> 01:27:54,761
She's quite a woman,
your mother.

2036
01:27:55,582 --> 01:27:57,471
I had a nice afternoon with Mags.

2037
01:27:57,629 --> 01:27:58,852
You met my mother.

2038
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:01,133
She likes her martinis
even stronger than yours.

2039
01:28:01,315 --> 01:28:03,069
We had a little walk
down memory lane.

2040
01:28:03,767 --> 01:28:05,695
She's a cold woman, Em.

2041
01:28:05,806 --> 01:28:07,846
I bet you couldn't do
anything right in her eyes.

2042
01:28:08,605 --> 01:28:10,859
It was probably Faith's idea
to set that fire.

2043
01:28:10,884 --> 01:28:12,528
Bet all the bad ideas were
Faith's, weren't they?

2044
01:28:12,599 --> 01:28:14,298
- You don't know anything.
- Sure, I do.

2045
01:28:14,824 --> 01:28:15,863
And I get it.

2046
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:17,527
<i>You're 16.</i>

2047
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:20,702
<i>It's that age where
you feel so trapped.</i>

2048
01:28:22,143 --> 01:28:24,611
<i>And if your mother always
had a biting comment...</i>

2049
01:28:31,298 --> 01:28:33,155
- Hey, it's over. Let's go.
- Dad. Dad!

2050
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,673
Dad! Don't touch me, Dad!

2051
01:28:35,836 --> 01:28:37,487
<i>I'm guessing your father
wasn't too much proud of it.</i>

2052
01:28:41,605 --> 01:28:44,344
That's when you figured to
hit the reset button, right?

2053
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:47,729
Burn, baby, burn.

2054
01:28:55,862 --> 01:28:57,203
Why'd you leave each other?

2055
01:28:57,427 --> 01:28:59,506
Well, we couldn't stay
together after the fire.

2056
01:29:00,431 --> 01:29:02,693
The cops were looking for
the big blond arson twins.

2057
01:29:02,725 --> 01:29:04,328
<i>We were a walking sideshow.</i>

2058
01:29:06,303 --> 01:29:07,272
<i>We, uh...</i>

2059
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:10,009
We had to say goodbye,
so we-we did it with tattoos.

2060
01:29:10,054 --> 01:29:13,006
<i>Flames, and a little
something for Charity.</i>

2061
01:29:18,376 --> 01:29:19,653
We split up in Corpus Christi.

2062
01:29:19,678 --> 01:29:21,266
She was gonna head
south to Mexico.

2063
01:29:21,331 --> 01:29:22,724
<i>I was gonna go north.</i>

2064
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,069
<i>We set a time and place to meet
after the smoke cleared.</i>

2065
01:29:27,105 --> 01:29:28,613
<i>But then, she never showed up.</i>

2066
01:29:29,727 --> 01:29:30,878
<i>I was worried sick.</i>

2067
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:32,363
<i>I waited for days.</i>

2068
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:33,731
<i>But nothin'.</i>

2069
01:29:34,385 --> 01:29:36,146
You know, I thought maybe
this was my opportunity

2070
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:37,044
to do it on my own.

2071
01:29:37,077 --> 01:29:38,345
She was always
gettin' me into trouble.

2072
01:29:38,409 --> 01:29:39,766
So I got a one-way ticket
to New York

2073
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:40,782
and never looked back.

2074
01:29:40,954 --> 01:29:43,096
- Did you miss her?
- Of course, I missed her.

2075
01:29:43,156 --> 01:29:44,505
I wasn't whole without her.

2076
01:29:44,608 --> 01:29:46,799
But I didn't go on like that.
I had to survive.

2077
01:29:46,842 --> 01:29:47,754
And it worked.

2078
01:29:47,779 --> 01:29:49,551
Yeah, my life in New York
fell into place.

2079
01:29:49,646 --> 01:29:51,996
I got a job, worked my way up.

2080
01:29:52,408 --> 01:29:54,004
I met the perfect man.

2081
01:29:54,906 --> 01:29:56,787
Oh, you know that part, though.

2082
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:58,287
Then your sister calls.

2083
01:29:58,346 --> 01:29:59,632
Fucking Facebook.

2084
01:29:59,719 --> 01:30:01,560
- You had to see her.
- Yeah, of course, I did.

2085
01:30:02,088 --> 01:30:04,929
So you fabricate this
trip to Miami.

2086
01:30:05,065 --> 01:30:06,518
Meet up at the old camp.

2087
01:30:06,582 --> 01:30:08,669
Yeah, bunk four.
It was our happy place.

2088
01:30:10,954 --> 01:30:12,922
<i>It's the only place we could
escape our dad, really.</i>

2089
01:30:22,053 --> 01:30:25,275
<i>It must have been shocking
to see her after all those years.</i>

2090
01:30:27,146 --> 01:30:29,416
<i>Yeah, it was like
looking at a mirror.</i>

2091
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,246
Except it was a sick life
she chose over me.

2092
01:30:32,492 --> 01:30:33,674
<i>What'd she want?</i>

2093
01:30:34,087 --> 01:30:35,269
<i>Everything.</i>

2094
01:30:37,403 --> 01:30:39,007
You just gonna stand there?

2095
01:30:39,959 --> 01:30:41,348
You gotta have faith.

2096
01:30:41,718 --> 01:30:44,424
I don't hear from you for
14 years, and now...

2097
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:46,908
- Here you are.
- I'm out of cash.

2098
01:30:46,976 --> 01:30:48,103
Shocking.

2099
01:30:49,526 --> 01:30:51,020
What the fuck d'you say?

2100
01:30:54,016 --> 01:30:55,072
Nothing...

2101
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,540
Get away with it this time.

2102
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:59,400
Okay, so, um, now what?

2103
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,139
I don't know.
I didn't know where to go.

2104
01:31:01,301 --> 01:31:03,245
When I called you,
you act like a stranger.

2105
01:31:03,373 --> 01:31:05,056
You won't even let me
come meet your family.

2106
01:31:05,104 --> 01:31:06,564
What am I supposed
to say to that?

2107
01:31:07,048 --> 01:31:08,064
The truth.

2108
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:10,804
Well, you may as well know,
'cause

2109
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:12,989
I'm about to tell the cops.

2110
01:31:13,044 --> 01:31:14,078
You what?

2111
01:31:14,155 --> 01:31:16,362
I-I don't know
what else to do.

2112
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:18,016
I mean,
I-I don't have anything,

2113
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,056
so I don't really have
anything to lose.

2114
01:31:20,329 --> 01:31:22,901
I'm gonna go tell 'em everything
we did, and then, you know...

2115
01:31:22,964 --> 01:31:24,702
We'll go down together,
we can be together.

2116
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:26,681
I have a little boy now.

2117
01:31:26,803 --> 01:31:29,351
Yeah, I know, I saw that kid.
He's super cute.

2118
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,227
Cut the shit, okay?
What do you want from me?

2119
01:31:34,509 --> 01:31:35,724
I want a million bucks.

2120
01:31:35,749 --> 01:31:37,360
How am I supposed to
give you that?

2121
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:38,565
You're rich and famous now.

2122
01:31:38,599 --> 01:31:40,329
I-I can't give you
a million dollars.

2123
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:43,105
You do seem highly motivated.

2124
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:44,605
I don't know what it is, though.

2125
01:31:44,807 --> 01:31:46,029
Probably it's your job.

2126
01:31:46,077 --> 01:31:47,918
Probably uh,
probably your kid.

2127
01:31:48,031 --> 01:31:49,404
Don't talk about Nicky.

2128
01:31:50,634 --> 01:31:51,967
Yeah, I'll...

2129
01:31:52,388 --> 01:31:55,804
I'll sell the house, I'll, um...
I'll do whatever I need to do.

2130
01:31:55,941 --> 01:31:57,599
If I do this, you can't
tell anyone ever,

2131
01:31:57,624 --> 01:31:58,824
do you understand?

2132
01:31:59,078 --> 01:32:00,118
Yeah, I get it.

2133
01:32:00,992 --> 01:32:02,151
I mean, I don't really get

2134
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,334
the big deal about this
you and me.

2135
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:04,302
you could always just...

2136
01:32:04,389 --> 01:32:06,806
I get that, like a kid.
You know that, right?

2137
01:32:07,818 --> 01:32:09,373
Can't remember
hittin' my sister up.

2138
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:12,299
It's fucking hot.

2139
01:32:12,982 --> 01:32:14,736
Come on, let's go swimming.

2140
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:16,571
My ride's gonna be here soon.

2141
01:32:17,987 --> 01:32:19,622
- You coming?
- Yeah.

2142
01:32:20,043 --> 01:32:21,305
I'm right behind you.

2143
01:32:32,187 --> 01:32:33,489
How'd you get her in the lake?

2144
01:32:33,578 --> 01:32:34,919
Fuck you, I didn't kill my sister.

2145
01:32:35,003 --> 01:32:36,110
It was her idea.

2146
01:32:43,993 --> 01:32:45,453
Come on, wimp.

2147
01:32:47,613 --> 01:32:49,652
What, I thought you
were the alpha now?

2148
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:50,819
No?

2149
01:32:50,884 --> 01:32:52,670
I am the alpha, God damn it.

2150
01:33:09,786 --> 01:33:11,421
You abandoned me.

2151
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,408
We were supposed to be
a team, you and me.

2152
01:33:14,683 --> 01:33:15,643
Remember?

2153
01:33:15,722 --> 01:33:17,373
Yeah, I know but we're a...

2154
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:21,082
I was so totally in a jam,
I was alone.

2155
01:33:22,047 --> 01:33:23,214
You were right.

2156
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,285
I'm sorry, kid.

2157
01:33:30,275 --> 01:33:31,394
Me too.

2158
01:34:27,235 --> 01:34:28,433
<i>I was so worried.</i>

2159
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:32,116
I woke up the next morning
and I-I couldn't find her anywhere.

2160
01:34:33,488 --> 01:34:34,805
I never thought...

2161
01:34:36,698 --> 01:34:38,809
I never thought
she'd do that, you know?

2162
01:34:41,353 --> 01:34:44,131
When I found her body
in the lake, it was too late.

2163
01:34:44,195 --> 01:34:45,314
Lie.

2164
01:34:45,482 --> 01:34:46,617
You drowned her.

2165
01:34:46,642 --> 01:34:48,112
No, she killed herself.

2166
01:34:48,503 --> 01:34:49,941
I'm just all
that's left of her.

2167
01:34:50,036 --> 01:34:51,441
No, you're a sister killer.

2168
01:34:51,528 --> 01:34:52,917
You're a brother fucker.

2169
01:34:53,075 --> 01:34:54,195
Ooh.

2170
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:55,615
What does Sean know?

2171
01:34:55,882 --> 01:34:56,970
Everything.

2172
01:34:57,732 --> 01:34:59,017
It was his idea.

2173
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:01,046
I didn't know what to do
once I found the body, and...

2174
01:35:01,126 --> 01:35:03,222
And he said, "You know, maybe
this is our opportunity.

2175
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:04,727
"We could finally
get out of debt.

2176
01:35:05,006 --> 01:35:06,244
"Leave the country.

2177
01:35:07,006 --> 01:35:08,491
"Spend more time with Nicky."

2178
01:35:08,581 --> 01:35:10,232
He convinced me
we could pull it off.

2179
01:35:10,297 --> 01:35:12,059
You know, that her DNA
would do the rest.

2180
01:35:12,114 --> 01:35:13,114
I don't believe you.

2181
01:35:13,194 --> 01:35:14,479
He grieved for you.

2182
01:35:14,531 --> 01:35:15,792
Oh, you believed that?

2183
01:35:15,817 --> 01:35:17,349
Aww, that was all an act.

2184
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:19,009
You're a pathological liar.

2185
01:35:19,104 --> 01:35:20,223
Did Sean say that.

2186
01:35:22,265 --> 01:35:23,233
Well.

2187
01:35:24,257 --> 01:35:26,202
I'm just gonna play this
to you, real quick.

2188
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,376
<i>Do you love her?</i>

2189
01:35:31,487 --> 01:35:33,567
<i>No. It was just sex.</i>

2190
01:35:33,839 --> 01:35:36,243
<i>Did you think of me
when you were fucking her?</i>

2191
01:35:36,906 --> 01:35:37,930
<i>Yes.</i>

2192
01:35:38,536 --> 01:35:40,068
<i>Do you love me or not, baby?</i>

2193
01:35:40,147 --> 01:35:41,480
<i>Of course, I do.</i>

2194
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:43,699
<i>She doesn't mean
a thing to me.</i>

2195
01:35:43,978 --> 01:35:46,112
I'm sorry, baby. I know
you thought it was real.

2196
01:35:48,103 --> 01:35:50,253
But hey, I mean,
look on the bright side.

2197
01:35:50,326 --> 01:35:52,596
Your website went viral,
thanks to me.

2198
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:54,367
All this for a little money?

2199
01:35:54,449 --> 01:35:56,957
A little four million dollars?

2200
01:35:57,801 --> 01:35:59,476
It's not exactly little, huh?

2201
01:36:00,496 --> 01:36:02,233
I was hiding out
till that money came in.

2202
01:36:02,258 --> 01:36:04,107
He was just gonna tie up
some loose ends.

2203
01:36:04,316 --> 01:36:05,427
Was I a loose end?

2204
01:36:05,771 --> 01:36:07,533
Well, he needed help with Nicky.

2205
01:36:07,723 --> 01:36:09,191
You're so good with those kids.

2206
01:36:09,775 --> 01:36:11,474
So, what happens now?

2207
01:36:11,785 --> 01:36:13,150
I just want my kid.

2208
01:36:14,197 --> 01:36:15,760
You fucked up my insurance plan.

2209
01:36:15,785 --> 01:36:17,506
Now the authorities won't
back down on that.

2210
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:18,897
You can have Sean,
he's a piece of shit.

2211
01:36:18,922 --> 01:36:19,913
I don't even want him.

2212
01:36:19,938 --> 01:36:21,116
I don't want Sean.

2213
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,187
I don't know, I got screwed.

2214
01:36:24,407 --> 01:36:26,271
There's another way, but...

2215
01:36:26,534 --> 01:36:28,629
So, one mother to another.

2216
01:36:28,654 --> 01:36:30,097
<i>♪ Laisse tomber les filles ♪</i>

2217
01:36:30,312 --> 01:36:31,949
<i>♪ Laisse tomber les filles ♪</i>

2218
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,639
<i>♪ Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera ♪</i>

2219
01:36:33,758 --> 01:36:35,203

What's going on?

2231
01:37:05,018 --> 01:37:07,192
They have a warrant.
I tried to call you.

2232
01:37:07,768 --> 01:37:09,951
Excuse me, I'm Sean Townsend.

2233
01:37:10,062 --> 01:37:11,792
Look, I'm happy to comply
with anything you need,

2234
01:37:11,817 --> 01:37:14,141
but it would be nice
to have a heads up.

2235
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:15,636
This is an open investigation.

2236
01:37:15,716 --> 01:37:17,962
You don't get to pencil us in
when it's convenient.

2237
01:37:25,122 --> 01:37:26,154
Hey!

2238
01:37:27,223 --> 01:37:28,294
Am I under arrest?

2239
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:30,684
Oh, no, no, not yet. The D.A.
wants to slide it back.

2240
01:37:30,784 --> 01:37:32,899
Well, that's gonna be pretty hard
since I haven't done anything.

2241
01:37:33,066 --> 01:37:34,471
Did you know your wife was alive?

2242
01:37:35,487 --> 01:37:36,574
Not until recently.

2243
01:37:36,599 --> 01:37:37,559
When?

2244
01:37:38,155 --> 01:37:39,305
She contacted me.

2245
01:37:39,337 --> 01:37:41,499
And you immediately notified
the authorities, right?

2246
01:37:42,271 --> 01:37:43,922
I can't discuss this
without my attorney.

2247
01:37:43,978 --> 01:37:46,168
You know what? You really are
a professor, aren't you?

2248
01:37:46,223 --> 01:37:47,422
Okay, we'll talk some.

2249
01:37:48,014 --> 01:37:49,918
Oh, uh, if we need
to contact you,

2250
01:37:49,943 --> 01:37:50,941
will you be with your wife

2251
01:37:50,966 --> 01:37:52,275
or the best friend?

2252
01:37:54,279 --> 01:37:55,391
Somebody else?

2253
01:38:05,194 --> 01:38:06,995
I need a stiff drink.
There were some...

2254
01:38:07,027 --> 01:38:08,210
I'm sorry, you can't come in.

2255
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:10,267
What?

2256
01:38:10,354 --> 01:38:11,378
Where's Nicky?

2257
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:12,731
He's upstairs playing.

2258
01:38:12,834 --> 01:38:13,786
You have to go.

2259
01:38:13,866 --> 01:38:14,953
What are you talking about?

2260
01:38:15,005 --> 01:38:17,140
This is an ongoing
investigation, Sean.

2261
01:38:17,187 --> 01:38:18,091
Oh, fucks sake.

2262
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:20,534
I can't let you in this house
until this whole thing's been solved.

2263
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:21,838
She's gotten to you, hasn't she?

2264
01:38:21,863 --> 01:38:23,060
This has nothing
to do with Emily.

2265
01:38:23,085 --> 01:38:25,217
It's got everything to do with her.

2266
01:38:25,931 --> 01:38:27,289
She's gaslighting you.

2267
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,231
You don't understand
how powerful she is.

2268
01:38:29,331 --> 01:38:31,310
No, I don't understand
anything right now.

2269
01:38:31,545 --> 01:38:32,817
Stephanie, don't do this.

2270
01:38:33,023 --> 01:38:34,716
Please don't make me
call the police.

Oh, please, Sean.
I'm not gonna poison you.

2324
01:41:16,585 --> 01:41:18,442
If I wanted to get rid or you,
you'd already be dead.

2325
01:41:19,326 --> 01:41:21,223
You put those files
in my computer.

2326

Yes, I did.

2327
01:41:23,736 --> 01:41:25,378
But I did have help from a woman

2328
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:27,434
who loves volunteering
for everything.

2329

Stephanie?

2330
01:41:29,325 --> 01:41:31,778
She's not as sweet
as her snatch, is she?

2331
01:41:31,837 --> 01:41:33,686
Were you ever gonna tell me
you had a twin sister?

2332
01:41:33,909 --> 01:41:34,949
Wasn't your business.

2333
01:41:35,012 --> 01:41:36,282
I'm your husband!

2334
01:41:36,364 --> 01:41:38,237
Oh, you've been fucking
my best friend in my house

2335
01:41:38,262 --> 01:41:39,404

2336
01:41:39,478 --> 01:41:40,344
Okay.

2337
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:43,011
Then I should probably tell
you that we were triplets.

2338
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:44,276

01:41:55,663 --> 01:41:58,695
You know, as shocked
as you guys are

2345
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:01,063
about these turns of events,

2346
01:42:01,088 --> 01:42:02,261
I can assure you

2347
01:42:02,301 --> 01:42:03,817
nobody is more stunned than me.

<i>I hope you can forgive me in
advance for what I have to do.</i>

2353
01:42:16,501 --> 01:42:17,468
Moms,

2354
01:42:17,571 --> 01:42:18,857
do everything yourself.

2355
01:42:22,539 --> 01:42:23,420
Stephanie.

2356
01:42:23,507 --> 01:42:24,817
You shouldn't be here right now.

2357
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:26,036
I used to live here.

2358
01:42:26,482 --> 01:42:27,306
Remember?

2359
01:42:27,331 --> 01:42:28,108
Don't make this any harder...

2360
01:42:28,133 --> 01:42:29,109
Don't move.

2361
01:42:31,385 --> 01:42:32,560
Stephanie, please.

2362
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:34,815
You don't even let the boys
play with squirt guns.

2363
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,426
That was before you
told me you loved me

2364
01:42:36,451 --> 01:42:38,213
and it turned out you were
laughing at me behind my back.

2365
01:42:38,475 --> 01:42:40,045
Stephanie, I wish
you'd have the courage.

2366
01:42:40,475 --> 01:42:41,769
You used me.

2367
01:42:42,087 --> 01:42:43,293
You used me, too.

2368
01:42:43,724 --> 01:42:45,264
You had me making you dinner.

2369
01:42:45,853 --> 01:42:47,131
Watching your kid

2370
01:42:47,226 --> 01:42:48,360
and sucking your dick.

2371
01:42:48,617 --> 01:42:50,474
I had no idea that
she was still alive.

2372
01:42:50,538 --> 01:42:51,562
Stop lying.

2373
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:53,168
Okay, guys.

2374
01:42:53,193 --> 01:42:55,105
I think we should just sit
down and talk this out.

2375
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,441
Emily, you sit down.

2376
01:42:56,497 --> 01:42:57,846
You hated Stephanie.

2377
01:42:57,904 --> 01:42:59,697
Used to watch her vlog
and rip her apart.

2378
01:42:59,891 --> 01:43:01,645
All I wanted
was to be her friend.

2379
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,947
You were.

2380
01:43:03,482 --> 01:43:05,649
And then you fucked my husband
and my insurance plan.

2381
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,633
Don't blame her!

2382
01:43:06,664 --> 01:43:08,617
This is so typical of you.

2383
01:43:08,653 --> 01:43:10,909
Sean, I was just trying to get us
out of crushing fucking debt.

2384
01:43:10,973 --> 01:43:13,616
Oh, yeah, maybe if you had the
good sense to give me a call,

2385
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,453
I could've helped you with
this little plot of yours.

2386
01:43:15,478 --> 01:43:17,557
Ugh, you haven't come up with
a decent plot in ten years.

2387
01:43:17,582 --> 01:43:19,503
Really? Right now?

2388
01:43:19,545 --> 01:43:21,719
Can I say something
as the lady with the gun?

2389
01:43:22,096 --> 01:43:23,747
Nicky deserves better
than both of you.

2390
01:43:23,773 --> 01:43:24,963
Fuck you, I love my kid.

2391
01:43:24,988 --> 01:43:25,908
Shut up.

2392
01:43:27,689 --> 01:43:28,888
Stephanie, put down the gun.

2393
01:43:30,216 --> 01:43:31,422
You don't wanna do this.

2394
01:43:31,716 --> 01:43:33,399
I really do, though.

2395
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:36,961
I loved you.

2396
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:39,710
Loved you too.

2397
01:43:42,459 --> 01:43:43,967
I think this is the best thing.

2398
01:43:44,057 --> 01:43:44,955
Hold on.

2399
01:43:45,336 --> 01:43:46,550
You know, we can say
he attacked us.

2400
01:43:46,575 --> 01:43:47,478
They'll believe us, you know.

2401
01:43:47,518 --> 01:43:49,050
No, no, no, no,
you're not fucking serious.

2402
01:43:49,105 --> 01:43:50,240
You're not gonna kill him.

2403
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:51,943
We're just gonna send him to jail.

2404
01:43:52,166 --> 01:43:54,008
J... Are you serious?

2405
01:43:54,033 --> 01:43:55,107
Jail's enough for you?

2406
01:43:55,170 --> 01:43:57,218
- You don't need to kill him.
- Aren't you angry?

2407
01:43:57,252 --> 01:43:58,974
Don't you want revenge
for your sister?

2408
01:43:59,049 --> 01:44:01,819
Yes, yes, but he didn't
technically kill her.

2409
01:44:02,019 --> 01:44:03,273
Then who did?

2410
01:44:03,823 --> 01:44:05,992
'Cause I don't buy
that it was an accident.

2411
01:44:08,913 --> 01:44:10,025
Screw this.

2412
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:14,086
Oh, my God.

2413
01:44:14,244 --> 01:44:15,649
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, my gosh.

2414
01:44:16,184 --> 01:44:17,858
Oh, my God, um...

2415
01:44:18,194 --> 01:44:19,281
Oh, my God!

2416
01:44:19,672 --> 01:44:20,918
Is he really dead?

2417
01:44:21,174 --> 01:44:22,166
Sean?

2418
01:44:22,253 --> 01:44:23,198
Oh, I'm sorry.

2419
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:24,002
What do I do? Do I...

2420
01:44:24,027 --> 01:44:25,295
Do you put pressure on it, or...?

2421
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,161
Uh...

2422
01:44:26,187 --> 01:44:27,281
Do we call an ambulance?

2423
01:44:27,306 --> 01:44:28,615
Do we just let him die?

2424
01:44:28,976 --> 01:44:30,897
I mean, he deserved it, right?

2425
01:44:31,638 --> 01:44:32,733
No, I killed her.

2426
01:44:32,844 --> 01:44:34,106
I killed my sister.

2427
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:35,132
What?

2428
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,005
Sean? Sean?

2429
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:38,331
Get up.

2430
01:44:41,051 --> 01:44:42,472
Show's over, come on.

2431
01:44:42,832 --> 01:44:44,681
Seriously? Come on.
Get the fuck up.

2432
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:46,761
Hey, you too, Brando.

2433
01:44:47,019 --> 01:44:47,963
Get up!

2434
01:44:48,058 --> 01:44:49,042
Fuck!

2435
01:44:53,821 --> 01:44:54,821
Wow.

2436
01:44:57,146 --> 01:44:58,519
That was extra.

2437
01:44:59,462 --> 01:45:01,422
I mean, obviously, I knew
you guys were up to something

2438
01:45:01,485 --> 01:45:02,731
when I saw both the mics

2439
01:45:02,756 --> 01:45:04,723
that you had the
cops plant in here.

2440
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:07,150
You clearly wanted a
confession out of me

2441
01:45:07,175 --> 01:45:08,619
so you could clear Sean's name.

2442
01:45:08,757 --> 01:45:09,899
Well, that was...

2443
01:45:09,987 --> 01:45:11,598
that was a good way
to go about it.

2444
01:45:12,061 --> 01:45:13,768
I mean, you really messed up,
though, baby girl.

2445
01:45:13,873 --> 01:45:16,339
'cause thinking that I
would confess to protect

2446
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:17,958
that fucking yeast infection?

2447
01:45:18,176 --> 01:45:19,001
Really?

2448
01:45:20,068 --> 01:45:21,600
Come on, you gotta
know better than that.

2449
01:45:23,084 --> 01:45:25,409
But then you came out
all emotional with the gun

2450
01:45:25,457 --> 01:45:26,460
and that was...

2451
01:45:26,521 --> 01:45:28,124
that was convincing.

2452
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,310
It was very cinematic.

2453
01:45:30,405 --> 01:45:31,959
How do you even know
where to find this shit?

2454
01:45:31,984 --> 01:45:33,611
You're really amazing.

2455
01:45:33,859 --> 01:45:35,494
Thanks, that means a lot.

2456
01:45:35,569 --> 01:45:36,459
Mmm.

2457
01:45:36,674 --> 01:45:38,172
But you did confess, Emily.

2458
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:41,944
Oh, yeah, um...

2459
01:45:43,702 --> 01:45:45,050
I did, but..

2460
01:45:45,103 --> 01:45:46,978
I cut these first, though

2461
01:45:47,055 --> 01:45:48,556
for our friendship bracelets.

2462
01:45:49,392 --> 01:45:50,662
One for you.

2463
01:45:51,027 --> 01:45:53,257
That is... disappointing.

2464
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:54,817
Oh.

2465
01:45:55,422 --> 01:45:57,010
My God, look what I found.

2466
01:45:58,918 --> 01:45:59,830
Okay.

2467
01:46:00,156 --> 01:46:02,664
You can't shoot us,
the police are outside.

2468
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:04,104
No, they're not.

2469
01:46:04,778 --> 01:46:06,754
Hey, cops, Stephanie here.

2470
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:08,259
Change of plans.

2471
01:46:08,284 --> 01:46:10,489
I'm meeting Emily and Sean
at Darren's house now.

2472
01:46:10,537 --> 01:46:11,489
I'll see you there.

2473
01:46:11,593 --> 01:46:12,958
You sent them to Darren's house?

2474
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:15,475
Virus.

2475
01:46:15,721 --> 01:46:17,697
String theory. String
theory, isn't it?

2476
01:46:19,093 --> 01:46:20,577
Heads up! Get down!

2477
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:22,175
I have a prescription for that!

2478
01:46:22,358 --> 01:46:23,747
I have ocular pressure!

2479
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:25,266
Come on, I've been on
the lam for ten years.

2480
01:46:25,322 --> 01:46:27,290
You think I don't know how
to manipulate the system?

2481
01:46:27,503 --> 01:46:28,761
So you're gonna kill us?

2482
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,389
Well, what the fuck else
am I supposed to do?

2483
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,028
You two will clearly go
to extraordinary lengths

2484
01:46:34,053 --> 01:46:36,188
to take me down and
you know too much.

2485
01:46:36,406 --> 01:46:38,485
So, I feel like a murder-suicide

2486
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:40,747
is the only fitting end
for you two.

2487
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:44,180
And if you kill him, I think our
insurance still covers that, right?

2488
01:46:44,675 --> 01:46:46,286
I mean, it's sort of perfect.

2489
01:46:46,311 --> 01:46:48,088
One door closes and
another one opens.

2490
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,064
Thank you for that.

2491
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:51,523
You always have been
fucking crazy, haven't you?

2492
01:46:51,610 --> 01:46:52,594
Have I?

2493
01:46:55,512 --> 01:46:56,846
Oh, shit, you're right.

2494
01:46:56,871 --> 01:46:59,164
Actually fucking-you
actually fucking shot me!

2495
01:46:59,954 --> 01:47:01,350
I'm gonna miss him.

2496
01:47:01,759 --> 01:47:02,727
Your turn.

2497
01:47:03,713 --> 01:47:05,292
Emily, come on.

2498
01:47:05,673 --> 01:47:07,110
You're not gonna kill me.

2499
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:09,686
Oh, yeah, I killed my dad
and my sister

2500
01:47:09,765 --> 01:47:12,670
but I can never kill my
husband-fucking best friend.

2501
01:47:13,437 --> 01:47:15,563
Am I really your best... friend?

2502
01:47:15,588 --> 01:47:17,556
You're not just saying
that for, you know?

2503
01:47:17,616 --> 01:47:19,410
No, no, I'm not
just saying that at all.

2504
01:47:19,602 --> 01:47:21,277
I get worried that it's just me.

2505
01:47:21,464 --> 01:47:23,027
I know, sometimes
I worry about that too.

2506
01:47:23,067 --> 01:47:23,948
Yeah.

2507
01:47:24,249 --> 01:47:26,058
It's so hard to connect
with other moms...

2508
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,681
Not many have a
full-time job, it's...

2509
01:47:27,753 --> 01:47:29,886
Okay, okay, don't pull that crap.

2510
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:32,340
Being a mom is a full-time job.
What I do is hard work.

2511
01:47:32,703 --> 01:47:34,098
And I have my vlog
on top of that

2512
01:47:34,123 --> 01:47:35,687
and that's just getting
bigger and bigger.

2513
01:47:36,032 --> 01:47:38,144
If you came on the vlog,
that'd be so fun.

2514
01:47:38,478 --> 01:47:39,899
If you came on the vlog,

2515
01:47:40,008 --> 01:47:41,444
and confessed to killing
your father and sister

2516
01:47:41,469 --> 01:47:42,364
and held me at gunpoint,

2517
01:47:42,389 --> 01:47:43,866
I could probably get a
million subscribers.

2518
01:47:43,911 --> 01:47:45,475
Aww, that would have been great.

2519
01:47:45,895 --> 01:47:47,165
Why don't we do that right now?

2520
01:47:47,548 --> 01:47:48,350
Hmm?

2521
01:47:48,445 --> 01:47:50,429
We're live streaming.
Did you not know that?

2522
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:51,915
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2523
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,963
Oh, that's so weird, I'm sorry, uh...

2524
01:47:54,642 --> 01:47:55,777
Wave hi to the moms!

2525
01:47:57,222 --> 01:47:58,285
Slick gadget.

2526
01:47:58,468 --> 01:47:59,309
Woop.

2527
01:47:59,428 --> 01:48:01,587
Yeah, they make nanny cams
so small these days.

2528
01:48:03,594 --> 01:48:04,784
Brother fucker.

2529
01:48:07,533 --> 01:48:08,367
Emily!

2530
01:48:09,054 --> 01:48:10,331
Emily, stop!

2531
01:48:10,625 --> 01:48:12,149
Emily, you cant outrun this.

2532
01:48:12,174 --> 01:48:13,403
Don't do this to Nicky.

2533
01:48:13,482 --> 01:48:14,839
Come on, you're still his mom.

2534
01:48:18,306 --> 01:48:19,330
Yeah, I am.

2535
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,967
But you sure as shit
won't be.

2536
01:48:29,443 --> 01:48:30,807
America's hybrids.

2537
01:48:31,276 --> 01:48:32,856
Silent but deadly.

2538
01:48:37,551 --> 01:48:38,702
I saw you on the vlog.

2539
01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:40,432
You fuck with one of the moms,

2540
01:48:40,702 --> 01:48:41,918
you fuck with us all.

2541
01:48:42,945 --> 01:48:44,540
Oh, Emily.

2542
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,463
Stop, Emily.

2543
01:48:48,258 --> 01:48:49,838
This looks super painful.

2544
01:48:50,287 --> 01:48:51,565
Now, sweetie...

2545
01:48:51,644 --> 01:48:53,676
Stop, you've just
been hit by a car.

2546
01:48:54,082 --> 01:48:55,466
Don't, don't do this.

2547
01:48:55,665 --> 01:48:57,736
I'm getting worried about
your knees right now.

2548
01:48:59,165 --> 01:49:00,117
Just relax.

2549
01:49:06,131 --> 01:49:07,219
I'm sorry.

2550
01:49:07,856 --> 01:49:09,534
I'm not sorry, urrh!

2551
01:49:09,614 --> 01:49:10,721
I'm still working on that.

2552
01:49:15,364 --> 01:49:16,642
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

2553
01:49:16,667 --> 01:49:18,716
We have very
exciting news today

2554
01:49:18,758 --> 01:49:21,701
because we signed up our
one millionth subscriber,

2555
01:49:21,734 --> 01:49:25,145
Mrs. Carol Findley
of Ames, Iowa!

2556
01:49:25,355 --> 01:49:27,164
Thank you for joining us, Carol.

2557
01:49:28,289 --> 01:49:30,273
You should know,
as our newest friend,

2558
01:49:30,346 --> 01:49:32,730
that in addition to my usual
helpful tips and recipes,

2559
01:49:32,859 --> 01:49:34,946
I now take on
unsolved mysteries.

2560
01:49:35,046 --> 01:49:36,220
'Cause it turns out

2561
01:49:36,308 --> 01:49:37,895
I have a nose for sniffing out

2562
01:49:37,927 --> 01:49:39,903
the freshest basil

2563
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:41,705
and criminals who thought
they got away with it.

2564
01:49:42,047 --> 01:49:43,697
So if you have a cold case

2565
01:49:43,753 --> 01:49:45,713
or a mystery that needs
to be unraveled,

2566
01:49:45,765 --> 01:49:48,328
just drop me a line, that
includes you now, Carol

2567
01:49:48,384 --> 01:49:49,757
'cause you're now
part of the family.

2568
01:49:50,386 --> 01:49:51,784
For now...

2569
01:49:51,864 --> 01:49:54,013
we're gonna be talking about
my favorite cold soup:

2570
01:49:54,038 --> 01:49:55,056
Gazpacho!

2571
01:49:55,081 --> 01:49:55,970
Which is normally gross

2572
01:49:55,995 --> 01:49:57,312
but we're not gonna
make it gross, right, guys?

2573
01:49:57,345 --> 01:49:58,203
It's gonna be great.
